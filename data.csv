3," SN 2021flc was discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) on 5 March 2021 with discovery mag 17.7, at the redshift of the host this is approximately -19.8 mag.
The Trinity College Dublin transients group obtained a spectrum of the object on 2021-03-21 23:40 (UT) using the SPRAT spectrograph onboard the Liverpool Telescope (Steele et al., 2004, Piascik et al. 2014).
We used our Python based classification tool and SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007) to classify the transient but found no conclusive match. Matches to SNe Ia were not convincing, with the better templates matches being those of SNe Ib/c, as found by our classification software. At -19.8 mag this would make SN 2021flc a candidate SLSN-I, however the host galaxy appears not to be consistent with typical SLSN hosts.
Follow up observations are encouraged in order to confirm the nature of this object.

18," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"", a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies that are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near-Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up. 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS1 takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night, reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). The w-band filter is a broad g+r+i composite. 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS21gqd (AT2021qvw) in the host galaxy CGCG 454-019, at a redshift of z = 0.025, or d = 111 Mpc (from NED). The transient was discovered on MJD 59386.55 (2021-06-21, 13:14:16 UTC) at mag m_w = 21.40 +/- 0.16. It is offset from the host by 11.3"" S, 4.0"" W (a projected 6.2 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -14.0 +/- 0.2 (assuming m-M = 35.23 and foreground exinction of  A_w = 0.14).
We followed the object up with Pan-STARRS1 three days later, measuring m_w = 22.12 +/- 0.26 on MJD 59389.56 (2021-06-24.56) with stacked forced photometry. Using forced photometry across both epochs, we measure a fading of 0.25 +/- 0.09 mag per day in the PS1 w-band. A screenshot of the Pan-STARRS flux (uJy) lightcurve and finder are included below.
There was no detection at the position of PS21gqd by Pan-STARRS when the field was last visited on MJD 59209. Running the transient position through the ATLAS forced photometry server (see Shingles et al. AstroNote 2021-7, Smith et al. 2020, PASP, 132, 085002 for details) and the ZTF forced-photometry service (Masci, F. et al. 2018, PASP, 131, 995.) revealed no obvious detection of a point source either historically or recently. This suggests the transient is likely intrinsically faint and not an old, fading supernova. Recent ATLAS and ZTF non-detections place limiting magnitudes of m_o > 20.1 on MJD 59383.54 and m_g > 20.2 and m_r > 19.5 on MJD 59385.4. A shock cooling signature of IIb supernova is possible, but it is more than 1 mag fainter than known IIb SNe cooling curves at their minimum. 
The luminosity and decline rate are consistent with the locus of viable kilonova models from Nicholl et al. (2021 arXiv:2102.02229). We measure the model decline rates for the PS1-w passband and transform them into a probability density function of decline rate versus absolute magnitude by applying a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation. PS21gqd falls well within the limits of these kilonova model contours.
Further photometric follow-up and spectroscopic classification are strongly encouraged.

30," We re-analysed the NTT+EFOSC2 spectrum of AT2019xis taken on 2019-12-28.29 UT (at phase ~70 days), and it is nearly identical to that of SN 1987A at about 70 days after explosion (see fig. 1). In addition, the I-band light curve provided by the OGLE survey, shifted by -17.2 mag, well matches that of SN1987A (fig. 2).
On the basis of the above arguments, we propose that AT2019xis is a light echo of SN1987A, hence SN light scattered towards us by a very small and compact dust cloud. This light echo is observed almost 33 years after the SN explosion.
If the dust cloud is approximately 200 pc in front of SN1987A, then the delay of 33 yrs is compatible with the light travel time and the observed angular separation.  The reflecting source is compact but marginally more extended than stellar sources in the EFOSC2 V-band images  (with 0.9"" seeing). This implies a physical size of the reflecting area of about 0.2 pc. 
The sky localization on AT2019xis is shown in fig. 3, along with that of SN1987A.

36," During the night of 2021 July 15 (UT), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) detected a new optical transient, internally designated ZTF21abmdcbi, at the following position (J2000):
01:41:20.10 +23:01:49.6
25.333731 +23.030432
The detection was made during routine observations as part of the partnership survey (SRG shadow program) and the public two-day cadence survey. The magnitude at the time of first detection (JD 2459410.9312) was r = 19.55 +/- 0.13 (all magnitudes AB, not corrected for Galactic extinction). It was subsequently detected in g-band on the same night (g = 19.42 +/- 0.14 at JD 2459410.9628). The last constraining ZTF nondetection was recorded 33 days prior (r > 21.30 at JD 2459377.9653). 
The source was saved to TNS on July 16 by ALeRCE (Forster et al 2021) and received the name AT2021tnj.
A significant (1 mag) decay in flux was observed over the next five days. Because of the relatively fast decline and blue colors during the decline, the source was flagged during daily scanning for fast transients on 2021 July 20. LT follow-up imaging on July 23 (g-r=-0.11 +/- 0.11 mag) and July 27 (g-r=-0.41 +/- 0.42 mag) confirmed the blue colors and fast decline.
We ran ATLAS forced photometry (Smith et al. 2020), which provided a c-band detection at 19.25 +/- 0.24 (JD 2459408.0824), three days before the first ZTF detection. The last ATLAS nondetection was recorded at o > 19.54 (JD 2459392.1027).
On July 23 we obtained a spectrum using our ToO program on Gemini South. The spectrum is blue and featureless except for emission lines from the host galaxy (H-alpha, H beta, OIII) at a redshift of z=0.228. The redshift makes the transient highly luminous, with a peak absolute magnitude of c < -21.1 mag (no K-correction).
Further follow-up with the Liverpool Telescope on July 29 UT (JD 2459424.65), while affected by moonlight and poor seeing, shows only a marginal detection (2-sigma) in the latest observation, and confirms that the source continues to fade rapidly.  The upper limits in the stacked observations are g>21.5, r>21.5, i>21.8.
The luminosity, color, and featureless spectrum are consistent with the population of fast, luminous blue transients typefied by AT2018cow (Ho et al. 2021, https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08811), although the rate of fading is somewhat slower.  We lack a constraint on the rise time of this transient.  Swift and VLA observations have been requested.
We thank the Gemini-South staff for their assistance scheduling and executing the ToO observation.

40," The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al. 2019; Graham et al. 2019) Infant Supernova Science Program (Gal-Yam 2019) reports the early discovery and rapid follow-up of ZTF20abxyjtx / 2020sic, following the methodology outlined by Gal-Yam et al. (2011).
The object was first detected on ZTF r-band images obtained on 1 September 2020 at 03:13 UT, about 2 days after the last non-detection, and was picked up by a fast transient custom ZTF filter. A duty astronomer saved the object and rapid follow-up was triggered. The object was publicly announced by Perley (2020TNSTR2691....1P).
Assuming the redshift of the host galaxy NGC 6001 (z=0.03324; NED), the SN was discovered at an absolute magnitude M_r=-16.3. Swift photometry has been triggered, and additional observations are ongoing.
During the 24 hours following its discovery, we obtained an optical spectrum with the ALFOSC spectrograph mounted on the 2.56-m Nordic Optical Telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Spain. We used a 1-arcsec slit and grism #4 covering the spectral range from 3500-9400 AA. The integration of the spectrum is 1800 s. The spectrum shows narrow emissions of H, He II, NIII, and CIV, indicative of flash features, super-imposed on a hot blackbody spectrum.
We will continue to distribute alerts on such early SN detections via AstroNotes; additional follow-up observations of this transient are encouraged.

We report here further follow-up photometry with the Palomar 60-inch telescope (using the Rainbow Camera on the SED Machine) showing a continued rapid decay in flux.   As of JD 2459143.6030 we measure r = 21.29 +/- 0.14 mag.
Follow-up is continuing but is hampered by poor weather at La Palma and the rapid fading of the source.  Deep optical imaging over the coming 1-2 weeks would be useful to confirm or rule out the presence of a radioactively-powered underlying supernova, which was not observed in AT2018cow (Perley et al. 2019, MNRAS, 484, 1031).

47," We draw attention to the fast fading lightcurve of AT2021den from the combined Pan-STARRS and ATLAS survey data and encourage rapid spectroscopic classification. 
Pan-STARRS discovered AT2021den (PS21aed; see Chambers et al. 2016, arXiv:1612.05560, and http://pswww.ifa.hawaii.edu) during the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" program (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details) on  2021-02-16.453 (MJD = 59261.330). AT2021den is likely associated with the nearby galaxy PGC 024745, offset by 1.4"" N, 5.1"" E or a projected distance of 3 Kpc, assuming a distance to PGC 024745 of 126 Mpc (from NED). If so, it would be M_w = -15.0 at peak. 
AT2021den was discovered at w = 20.5 and subsequently followed up by Pan-STARRS six days later at w = 21.2 on 2021-02-23.396 (MJD = 59267.396). We measure a fading of 0.12 mag per day in the PS1 w-band. A screenshot of the Pan-STARRS lightcurve and finder are included below.
The latest non-detection at the position of AT2021den by Pan-STARRS in the i-band occurred 44 days ago on 2021-01-03.547 (MJD = 59217.547). Running the transient position through the ATLAS forced photometry server (see Shingles et al. AstroNote 2021-7 for details) revealed no obvious detection of a point source during the Pan-STARRS gap, suggesting the transient is likely intrinsically faint and not an old supernova. The lack of ZTF detections (via https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/) also indicates it is not an old supernova. 
The luminosity and decline rate are consistent with the locus of viable kilonova models from Nicholl et al. (2021 arXiv:2102.02229). Using one-quarter of these models (those with chirp mass between 0.7 and 1 Solar masses), we measured the decline rates for ugrizy, PS1-w and ATLAS-co passbands and transform them onto a contour probability function of decline rate versus absolute magnitude by applying a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation. AT2021den falls within the limits of these kilonova model contours.  It's luminosity and decline rate are also similar to some very bright Luminous Blue Variable eruptions.  
Spectroscopic classification is required and/or near-infrared imaging to check for excess in these bands.

We report rapid fading of the transient ATLAS20njy (AT2020krl). The transient declined from o = 18.14 +/- 0.10 mag (orange-band) on MJD 58990.47 to  c = 18.72 +/- 0.10 mag (cyan-band) on MJD 58992.48. It was also detected by ZTF at g = 18.17 +/- 0.06, r = 18.44 +/- 0.07 on MJD 58991.43.  The ZTF g+r photometry implies a synthetic cyan-band mag of c = 18.3, which  would mean a decline of 0.4 mag in the cyan band in 24hrs. 
The discovery Astronote 2020-109 (Smith et al.) points at M = -16.5 if it is associated with UGC 11262 (81 Mpc) and it is offset by a projected distance of 17 kpc. 
A spectrum obtained using LT/SPRAT on MJD 58991.96 shows a blue, featureless continuum.  This is either a fast declining faint transient (and a kilonova candidate) or a foreground CV. Further observations are planned and encouraged.

54," Motivated by recent discovery and classification reports of transients with spectra showing strong narrow (<~1000 km/s) emission lines (including potential narrow P-Cygni profiles) of carbon and/or oxygen, but lacking lines of hydrogen and helium, we propose to use a new spectroscopic SN type - SN Icn - to refer to such objects, following the current SN classification as implemented in types IIn and Ibn (events with narrow lines of hydrogen and helium, respectively).   
Fiducially we propose that events showing spectra with strong emission lines of CNO elements but lacking prominent lines of H and He (in particular the He II 4686) would be classified as SNe Icn. Several relevant example are listed in the table below, including recent reports by Perley et al. (AstroNote 2021-62; 2021TNSAN..62....1P), Pastorello et al. (AstroNote 2021-71; 2021TNSAN..71....1P) and the classification of the earlier SN 2019hgp (Class. report 9002; 2021TNSCR.547....1G). A potentially related object could be SN 2010mb where Ben-Ami et al. 2014 (2014ApJ...785...37B) reported transient narrow emission lines of oxygen, though that object appears to differ photometrically and spectroscopically from the recently reported events.
We propose that should transitional events between types Ibn (prominent He lines, no C/O lines) and Icn (prominent C/O, no/weak He) appear, i.e., events whose spectra show narrow C/N/O and He lines with comparable strengths, those events should be classified as Ibn/Icn.

55," We observed the candidate afterglow ZTF21aayokph/AT2021lfa (Yao, Perley, and Ho, GCN Circ. 29938) with GMOS-S under our ToO program GS-2021A-Q-124 (PI: Ho). The observation, conducted in the Nod-and-Shuffle mode with a 1 arcsec slit, started at 2021-05-05 04:19:19 UT, corresponding to 22.7 hours after the first ZTF detection.
 
We obtained 2 x 450 s spectroscopic exposures with the B600 grating and 2 x 450 s exposures with the R400 grating, providing coverage over the range 3620-9540 AA. No flux calibration was performed. The spectrum was reduced using the IRAF package for GMOS. 
 
We clearly identified absorption lines of Mg II 2796 and Mg II 2803 at the redshift of z = 1.063 in the B600 and R400 spectra. Absorption lines from Mg I and Fe II are marginally detected in the spectra at consistent redshift. We therefore identify z=1.063 as the most probable redshift for AT2021lfa, although in practice this is only a lower limit. The lack of a DLA places an upper limit of z < 2.3.
 
We thank the GMOS-S observing staff for rapidly scheduling and executing our observations, in particular Jeong-Eun Heo.

74," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" which is a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near-Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS20eok (AT2020nrx) in the host galaxy GSG 039, at a redshift of z = 0.037 or d = 156 Mpc (from NED). The transient was discovered on MJD 59027.52 == 2020-06-27.52 at m_w = 20.80 +/- 0.13. It is offset from the host by 9.5"" S, 9.6"" E (a projected 10.6 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -15.3 (assuming m-M = 35.97 and foreground extinction of A_r = 0.17). Spectroscopic classification is encouraged. 
We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
The discoveries from this program are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations. Operation of the Pan-STARRS1 and Pan-STARRS2 telescopes is primarily supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under Grant No. NNX12AR65G and Grant No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near-Earth Object Observations Program.

76," Following the details described in AstroNote 2019-15, we have deployed today the revision in the treatment of object coordinates on the TNS, according to the defined astrometric accuracies of the reporting groups/surveys.
From now on, if an additional public AT report is received for an existing object, and this new report is from a group that has a better astrometric accuracy, the object's ""principal"" coordinates will be updated according to the new report.
Moreover, this revised treatment affects the decision whether to create a new object or associate a new report with an existing one. A new object will be created whenever the separation of a new report from all known objects is larger than the square root of the sum of the defined astrometric accuracies (uncertainties) squared of the new report and existing objects, or if there's a temporal difference of >= 5 years between the discovery dates of the new report and the existing objects.
As part of the deployment of this new mecahnism, we've updated backwards the principal object coordinates for a total of 3157 objects, as listed in the attached log file (sorted by the new group and object names). Comments were also added to all relevant object pages on the TNS. We DID NOT merge or split any objects in a bulk automated way, so there is no change to the objects and their IDs, and no changes to the AT reports - all are kept untouched.
As shown in the table below (and also on the TNS Groups page), we currently have in place values for the astrometric accuracy of  9 specific groups, based on the 95 percentiles (of the separation distributions w.r.t. the Gaia reported coordinates), and we have decided to begin by introducing a more conservative 30% safety buffer (instead of 20%; see AstroNote 2019-15). For the GOTO group, the value is based on private communication. For all other groups, the default accuracy of 5 arcsec is applied, which doesn't mean that this is their true accuracy but just that we have no other reliable value in hand for applying. Therefore, we encourage the surveys to contact us and provide us with comments and feedback. 
In this respect, another rule that is currently implemented is that an object's coordinates will not be updated if the existing coordinates are from a group for which the default value of 5"" is set, and the new AT report originates from a group with an accuracy worse than 2"".
Last, if an object's coordinates are set by some group and the same group submits an additional report for the same object but with slightly different coordinates (within the defined accuracy), the new most recent coordinates will replace the previous ones as the object's coordinates.

82," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" which is a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS19fco (AT2019qiq) in the host galaxy MCG -01-60-027, at a redshift of z = 0.029 or d = 118 Mpc (from NED).  The transient was discovered at MJD 58744.42 == 2019-09-18.42, at m_i = 20.45 +/- 0.24. It is offset from the host by 6.94"" S, 5.56"" E (a projected 4.4 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_i = -14.99 (assuming m-M = 35.37 and foreground extinction of A_i = 0.074). Spectroscopic classification is encouraged. 
Information on all objects discovered by the ""Pan-STARRS search for kilonovae"" will be made available at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/. We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
These discoveries are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations supported by the NASA Grants, including No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near Earth Object Observations Program.

84," We report the classification of 32 Type II supernovae (among which are two Type IIb and four Type IIn) from the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory. The classification spectra were obtained with the following telescopes/instruments: DBSP (Double Beam Spectrograph) on the Palomar 200 inch telescope, LRIS (Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) on the 10 m Keck-I telescope, the SED Machine on the Palomar 60 inch telescope, GMOS (Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs) on the 8 m Gemini-North telescope, DOLORES (Device Optimized for the Low Resolution) on the 3.5 m TNG telescope and the Deveny-LMI on the 4.3 m LDT (Lowell Discovery Telescope, formerly called the DCT - Discovery Channel Telescope.
These transients constitute the majority of a set of Type II SNe that were reported by iPTF and/or other surveys to the TNS but for which no classifications were so far reported (thus they remained with a prefix of ""AT""; now switched to ""SN"").
We summarise the classifications in the Related Objects table below.
Additional information for all these SNe can be found in the (i)PTF core-collapse sample paper by Schulze et al. (arXiv:2008.05988). The released classification spectra are also available on WISeREP (https://www.wiserep.org).

The object was detected on a ZTF g-band image obtained on October 21, 2020 at 3:57 UT with 18.28+-0.09 mag, ~1:22 hours after a reported non-detection in ZTF r-band (21.17 mag). Its ZTF light curve can be explored in https://alerce.online/object/ZTF20aclwclm. The sigma-clipped average magnitude for ATLAS o-band detections in the same night is 17.39+-0.06 mag at 5:08 UT. ZTF20aclwclm is located in the galaxy NGC 6574, which has a redshift of 0.0076. We encourage additional follow-up observations of this transient.

86," SN2019hge was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF19aawfbtg) on 2019-05-31 11:11:30 (UT) at 20.9 mag in the g band and was subsequently detected by ATLAS and PS1. The ZTF light curve is available here: https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/object/ZTF19aawfbtg/.
The light curve is double-peaked and rose to a peak apparent g-band magnitude of ~18.1 mag in ~53 days before rapidly declining some 30 days later. 
Galactic reddening in the direction of the transient is E(B-V) = 0.08 mag, assuming Rv =3.1.  The transient evolves at an almost constant colour pre-peak of g-r ~ -0.1 mag, with only a very gradual redward movement. The latest photometry shows a sudden evolution to the red. 
We observed the transient using the SPectrograph for the Rapid Acquisition of Transients (SPRAT; Piascik et al. 2014) on the Liverpool Telescope (LT; Steele 2004) on 2019-08-23 00:01:51.05 (UT) as part of the Trinity College Dublin (TCD) transient classification programme. The transient is clearly detected in the acquisition image. The spectrum displays P-Cygni features commensurate with SNe in the photospheric phase, there is no indication of host emission lines.
Comparing the observed spectrum with the templates of SNID (Blondin and Tonry, 2007) and Gelato (Harutyunyan et al., 2008, A&A, 488, 383) gives matches to SNe IIb at a redshift of 0.08 - 0.1, although the features between 4000 - 5000 Å appear similar to Fe II lines in post-peak SNe Ic-6 (e.g. SN 1994I, see Prentice & Mazzali, 2017).
The estimated redshift gives an peak absolute magnitude in g between -19.9 and -20.4 mag when correcting for Galactic extinction. This peak luminosity is far greater than that seen for typical SNe IIb and the colour evolution significantly bluer (Prentice et al. 2016, 2019).

59464.6267 ip 20.7 0.2

We also note a HST/WFPC2 F606W image obtained on UTC 1997-03-26 13:01:55.200 with a possible counterpart at the location of this source.  Aperture photometry of the HST counterpart suggests it was 21 mag at the time.  The agreement between this magnitude and the counterpart observed ~22 hours before the ATLAS discovery suggests they may be the same source.  In either case, the relatively faint magnitude of the MuSCAT3 source observed 22 hours before the ATLAS discovery of a source with m_c = 15.3 mag suggests an extremely rapid rise, and combined with the absolute magnitude of -16.4 mag, a likely young supernova.

Two filters are used, cyan and orange (denoted c and o; all mags quoted are in the AB system). While carrying out the primary mission for Near Earth Objects, we search for and publicly report stationary transients to the IAU Transient Name Server.  Data processing is carried out at Queen's University which combines automated source parameter filtering, machine learning image recognition, and spatial cross-matching with astronomical catalogues (Smith et al. 2020, PASP, 132:085002). More information is on the ATLAS homepage.

Following their public classification by ZTF (Gezari et al. 2021, AstroNote 2021-103; TNS Classification Report No. 10315; TNS Classification Report No. 9924), we observed the TDEs AT2021ehb, AT2021mhg, and AT2021nwa with NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The data were reduced in CASA using NRAO's standard VLA calibration pipeline. We report the non-detection of radio emission to the 3-sigma upper limits listed below. Further observations are planned to check for late-rising radio emission.
Our VLA Large Program (20B-377) began in December 2020 and will continue until 2023. We plan to target new publicly-reported TDEs discovered at z < 0.1, to determine the prevalence of radio emission in TDEs. We will report new results from this program to the community via ATels, TNS AstroNotes, and on our program website (https://sites.northwestern.edu/radiotdes/).

The repository provides information about objects, their spectra, photometry and related metadata, and as of May 2021 consists of >33,000 public spectra for >15,000 objects (mostly SNe).
We're glad to notify that WISeREP was officially migrated today to the AWS cloud, and the production site is now available at: https://www.wiserep.org. The Sandbox environment is active at https://sandbox.wiserep.org.
All registered users, groups and memberships remain as they are; so there is no need to re-register or perform any changes.
We take this opportunity to remind and clarify the following:

In the new WISeREP version (deployed Sep 2018), the uploading and contribution of data (spectra, light curves, phase information...) is done directly by the registered users/bots, with the possibility to use either the interactive report form or via bulk uploads – using either the Bulk Report Form or the available APIs.
Please check the Help page for detailed explanations, including downloadable Python sample codes (under the API-Bulk Report section).
There are separate Search pages for objects and spectra, which contain many query options, as well as the possibility to retrieve specific spectra (also of different objects) for over-plotting on the aggregated spectra plot.
Spectral plots have interactive analysis utils, including overplotting of many relevant elements (and ionization levels), with the ability to specify redshifts and expansion velocities, as well as specific functions (built in a unique javascript tool - ""iFigure"") for obtaining blackbody fits (temperatures), line fluxes, FWHM etc.
A clarification about the TNS & WISeREP: The TNS is a name server and the official hub for reporting the discovery of extragalactic transients. As such, it mainly hosts discovery and classification information (photometry points and classification spectra). WISeREP is a general data repository, of mostly supernovae but also other transients and objects of interest (CVs, Novae, AGNs etc), therefore this is the natural place for holding more extended light curves and spectral sequences, and making those available to the public.
All TNS classified objects are automatically migrated to WISeREP, with the object details and spectra.
Synthetic (computed) spectra are also being hosted on WISeREP with references to the published papers, and we encourage the contribution of those for further exposure of the modeling efforts and the ability to compare it (using our interactive over-plotting functionality) with the observed spectra.
Last, a reminder that all groups and memberships are self-managed by the (registered) users; so WISeREP is ideal (and is being used extensively by several groups/surveys) also as a sharing platform among group members; which is found useful and valuable for the sharing of both the proprietary and the public data.

Don't forget to update your URLs and links, including those that are being specified in papers.

120," We report the discovery of a fast-evolving red transient by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public all-sky survey and the Liverpool Telescope (LT). 
 
ZTF21aayokph (AT2021lfa) was discovered at the position (J2000) of:
ra = 12:32:48.725 (188.203019 deg)
dec = -01:29:22.56 (-1.489601 deg)
on 2021 May 4 by ZTF at r=18.60 +/- 0.08 mag (MJD=59338.2325) and g=18.80+/-0.11 mag (MJD=59338.3126). The last upper limits were on 2021 May 2 at g > 20.58 mag (MJD=59336.2569) and r > 20.23 mag (MJD=59336.3110). The rise rate (>0.85 mag/day) of AT2021lfa is therefore very fast. The Galactic extinction towards the direction of AT2021lfa is E(g-r)=0.02. The nearest counterpart in Legacy Survey deep imaging is 2.9 arcsec away (g=24.2, r=23.5).
 
The high Galactic latitude, red color, and lack of stellar counterpart or bright host galaxy motivated us to trigger follow-up observations.
 
Multi-band LT imaging at 15.5 hours and 19 hours after the first detection revealed rapid fading (1.9 mag/day in r-band) and colors consistent with a non-thermal SED. At the time of the most recent LT observation (at MJD 59339.04026) we measure r=20.12+/-0.04 mag and g=20.52 +/- 0.04 mag. 
 
We did not identify any GRBs coincident with this position during the time window between the last non-detection and the first detection.
 
The fast rise, fast decay, red color, and lack of counterpart of AT2021lfa make it a strong candidate afterglow.

122," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"", a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies that are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near-Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up. 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS1 takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night, reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). The w-band filter is a broad g+r+i composite. 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS21mbb (AT2021aeba) in the host galaxy SDSS J080844.91+184204.6, at a redshift of z = 0.044, or d = 191 Mpc (from NED). The transient was discovered on MJD 59526.57 (2021-11-08, 13:40:48 UTC) at mag m_w = 21.69 +/- 0.08. It is offset from the host by 2.3"" N, 3.5"" E (a projected 3.4 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -14.82 +/- 0.17 (assuming m-M = 36.40 and foreground exinction of  A_w = 0.11). A screenshot of the finder is included below.
We followed the object up with Pan-STARRS1 two days later, measuring m_w = 22.30 +/- 0.15 on MJD 59528.56 (2021-11-10, 13:26:24 UTC) with forced photometry. Using forced photometry across both epochs, we measure a fading of 0.3 +/- 0.1 mag per day in the PS1 w-band. Further follow-up were performed on MJD 59529.61 (2021-11-11, 14:36:57 UTC) and MJD 59530.58 (2021-11-12, 13:50:52 UTC) obtaining multicolour (grizy) photometry. Again using forced photometry, we measured m_r = 22.63 +/- 0.13 and m_r = 22.79 +/- 0.16 across the two epochs respectively, and g-r ~ 0.1 and r-i ~ 0.1 on the first multicolour epoch implying that the transient is blue in colour. 
There was no detection at the position of PS21gqd by Pan-STARRS when the field was last visited on MJD 59278 (2021-03-05). Running the transient position through the ATLAS forced photometry server (see Shingles et al. AstroNote 2021-7 for details and Smith et al. 2020, PASP, 132, 085002) and the ZTF forced-photometry service (Masci, F. et al. 2018, PASP, 131, 995) revealed no obvious detection of a point source either historically or recently. This suggests the transient is likely intrinsically faint and not an old, fading supernova. Recent ATLAS and ZTF non-detections place 3σ limiting magnitudes of m_o > 20.7 on MJD 59525.53 (2021-11-07, 12:43:12. UTC) and m_g > 21.3 on MJD 59526.33 (2021-11-08, 07:55:12 UTC) respectively.
The luminosity and decline rate are consistent with the locus of viable kilonova models from Nicholl et al. (2021 arXiv:2102.02229). We measure the model decline rates for the PS1-w passband and transform them into a probability density function of decline rate versus absolute magnitude by applying a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation. PS21gqd falls well within the limits of these kilonova model contours, however, a shock cooling signature of IIb supernova or a very luminous LBV outburst are also plausible given the transient's apparent blue colour.
Further photometric follow-up and spectroscopic classification are strongly encouraged.

132," AT 2021ont (ZTF21abdmevk) was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility in the nucleus of a z=0.028 galaxy on June 3, and it is currently rising. An archival SDSS spectrum of the host galaxy, SDSS J162642.49+390842.8, taken in April 2003 indicates a starburst galaxy, with prominent, narrow Balmer and forbidden emission lines.
 
We obtained an optical spectrum with the SPRAT instrument mounted on the Liverpool Telescope (through OPTICON program OL21A01, PI: Arcavi) at  2021-06-06 23:25:23 UT. The SPRAT spectrum shows a bluer continuum compared to the SDSS spectrum, a significantly higher Hbeta / [OIII]5007 line ratio, and a new emission feature around rest-frame 4680A, consistent with a blend of HeII 4686A and NIII 4640A emission lines. These characteristics have been previously associated with Bowen Fluorescence Flares (BFFs) - a class of enhanced accretion events around supermassive black holes (Trakhtenbrot et al. 2019, Nature Astronomy, 3, 242), likely driven by intense EUV flares that lead to the excitation of the Bowen Fluorescence cascades.

The observation was conducted on the 2020-01-11.13 for 4 hours at a central frequency of 15.5 GHz. The custom pipeline REDUCE_DC (e.g. Perrott et al. 2015) was used to calibrate and flag the data, with 3C286 as the absolute flux calibrator and J1215+1654 as the interleaved phase calibrator.

We detect an unresolved source at the phase center and fitted it with the CASA task IMFIT. The peak flux was ~10 mJy/beam at RA: 12:22:54.972, Dec: +15 49 21.574. Given the large size (~30 arcseconds) of the AMI beam, we can not separate, at this time, the supernova emission from the emission of two previously detected FIRST radio sources, which are located a few arcseconds from the position of SN2020oi. However, given the cataloged flux of the FIRST sources at 1.4 GHz compared to the flux level we detect with AMI, we conclude that a significant fraction of the emission detected by AMI originates from SN2020oi. We continue to monitor the source and are in search of flux variations.

We would like to thank the MRAO staff for carrying out these observations.

140," ZTF21abhywxv (AT2021qyd) is a young (<5 day) transient first detected by ZTF on UT 2021 June 25 and saved to the TNS by ALeRCE (Munoz-Arancibia et al. 2021).
The source was observed again the next night (June 26) as part of the ZTF high-cadence partnership survey. From the first to second night, the light curve appeared to fade in r-band. Due to the young age of the source, the fast fading, and the presence of a host galaxy, AT2021qyd passed two filters for rapidly evolving transients, the ZTF fast-transient filter pipeline developed by A. Ho and Y. Yao (Perley et al. 2021, arXiv:2103.01968) and the ZTFReST pipeline (Andreoni et al. 2021, arXiv:2104.06352).
LT observations obtained 1.6 days after the first ZTF detection confirmed the fast-fading nature, at 0.6 mag/day in g-band and 0.5 mag/day in r-band. The color is blue: g-r= -0.13 +/- 0.09 mag during the LT observation. 
The host galaxy is bright (g=18.45, r=17.89, z=17.50 in Legacy Survey DR9). The Legacy Survey photometric redshift is 0.03, with 68% bounds of [0.01, 0.14]. The implied peak absolute magnitude is -15.77 (68% interval [-14.23, -19.6]). 
Given the bright host galaxy and blue colors, this is likely to be shock-cooling emission from a nearby supernova, similar to fast-evolving Type IIb and Type Ib SNe observed by ZTF (Ho et al. 2021, arXiv:2105.08811). However, due to a lack of spectroscopy and host-galaxy redshift, we cannot rule out more exotic scenarios (e.g., transients like AT2018cow). 
We encourage spectroscopic classification. The most recent LT magnitudes are g=20.48 +/- 0.07 mag and r=20.61 +/- 0.06 mag (MJD 59391.9).

150," ZTF21abdmevk was discovered on 2021-06-03 at 08:20:14.997 by ZTF. A spectrum obtained 3 days after the first detection with DBSP (P200) showed a strong He II emission line with a linewidth of ~ 500km/s, typical of flash ionised circumstellar material at early times in SNe II . 
We monitored the evolution of the He II line and constrained its disapperance to less than a week from the first detection. 
 
The ALFOSC+NOT spectrum, obtained >~ 1 month after first detection shows broad Balmer lines. We hence reclassify this transient as a supernova of type II.

151," SN 2020aekp was discovered by Gaia in an observation taken on 2020-12-27 and was also detected by ZTF (Bellm et al. 2019; Graham et al. 2019) and several other time-domain sky surveys.  We initially classified this event as a SN Ia (TNSCR 2021-135) using a low-resolution spectrum taken around maximum light using the SED Machine IFU spectrograph (Blagorodnova et al. 2018, Rigault et al. 2019).  The early evolution of the SN light curve is consistent with Type Ia SNe.  However, the decline of the light curve slows starting about 20 days after peak, eventually flattens, and the light curve is now (~130 days post-discovery) showing a slight rebrightening.
We acquired a second spectrum with the SED Machine on 2021-05-08 which shows strong, asymmetric narrow+intermediate-width emission from H-alpha in addition to a strong calcium-triplet in the NIR and broad iron pseudo-continuum in the blue.  These features are charcteristic of interacting transients and particularly strongly resemble previous SNe of type Ia-CSM (e.g., Silverman et al. 2013).  Unusually, in this case the signs of strong interaction did not develop until well after the initial peak.
The source remains relatively optically bright (~18 mag) and well-positioned for follow-up by ground-based observatories for several more months.

The spectrum was integrated for 2700s and had an observed-frame wavelength coverage of 3640-6950 \AA.
We detect narrow- and intermediate-width components to the H\beta, H\gamma and H\delta emission profiles that imply interaction with circumstellar hydrogen. We also detect narrow [O III] 4959,5007 emission, and other narrow emission lines attributed to low-ionisation states of iron (Fe I and Fe II) that likely originate from the host galaxy. The implied redshift is z = 0.243, which implies a ZTF g-band absolute magnitude of Mg = -20.6. Given the bright absolute magnitude, we suggest that this object is a Type IIn superluminous supernova (SLSN). Further follow-up observations are encouraged.

The spectrum of SN2019yzw displays similarities to SN2004aw (Ic), SN2002ic (Ic/Ia-CSM), and PTF11kx (Ia-CSM), although we cannot rule out the narrow emission being solely from the host.
We took acquisition images (30s and 60s in V) of AT2019zel and did not detect the transient. The images were taken in twilight and have detection limits of around V ~ 20. This indicates the object has faded from c = 19.2 +/- 0.2, when it was discovered (MJD  58846.6)  to fainter than 20 on 58850.4. Further data will be taken to confirm if the transient is visible.

174," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" which is a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, arXiv:1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of a (possible) intrinsically faint transient PS20kxg (AT2020zck) with PS2.  It is offset from a possible host (14.6"" N, 54.2"" E) 2MASXJ00085765-0836093 which has a redshift of z = 0.108, or d = 75 Mpc (from NED).  The transient was discovered at MJD 59161.275 (2020-11-08 06:36 UTC) at mag w = 20.5 +/- 0.1. At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -14.0 +/- 0.1 (assuming m-M = 34.4 and foreground exinction of  A_w = 0.1). 
ZTF detected AT2020zck (see lightcurve on Lasair, object ZTF20acppuiq ) on 59164.3 at r = 20.2 +/- 0.3 and g = 19.9 +/- 0.3, and the recent lightcurve points are given below. The uncertainties on the ZTF magnitudes are large, but could imply a large colour change. Non-detections by PS1, ATLAS and ZTF imply this is not a normal, old supernova in 2MASXJ00085765-0836093 . Given it is offset from the host (22 kpc projected), intrinsically faint and (possibly) an unusual colour change, follow-up is encouraged.
It could also be a background SN or foreground galactic outburst. There is no obvious distant host galaxy in the  PS1 3Pi grizy stacks, but a faint source marginally detected, is visible in our w-band reference stack. This could imply a background galaxy or satellite of 2MASXJ00085765-0836093.

The transient passed the Nuclear Transients GROWTH Marshal filter with coordinates consistent with the nucleus of the host galaxy within 0.12''. The object was publicly announced by ALeRCE and AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019) via the TNS. It has continued to rise monotonically for ~25 days by ~1.5 mag while maintaining a constant g-r color. The ZTF Nuclear Transients Program triggered a follow-up observation with the SED Machine IFU Spectrograph mounted on the Palomar 60-inch (Blagorodnova et al. 2018), and we obtained a spectrum taken 20 days after discovery on 2020 Jul 16. The follow-up spectrum displayed a steep blue continuum, a broad H-alpha+[N II] line complex with FWHM ~ 125 Å, as well as a strong broad He II 4686 line profile. We report the classification of the follow-up spectrum of this transient as a likely tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate, joining the large sample of ZTF TDEs reported in van Velzen et al. 2020. The WISE color of the host galaxy WISEA J165812.98+020703.0 was not clearly AGN-like (W1-W2=0.23+/-0.04), although it displayed variability in WISE in the past. We triggered high cadence monitoring by the Neil Gehrels Swift Telescope to determine whether UV/X-rays are concurrent with the transient, and additional spectroscopic observations are ongoing. We encourage further spectroscopic follow-up observations of this TDE candidate, which is still pre-peak.

190," We report our initial analysis of the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observation of the nearby (~17 Mpc) supernova SN2020oi in M100. SN2020oi was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266), reported by the ALeRCE broker (TNS report 58241, Forster et al.), and classified as a Type Ic SN by Siebert et al. (ATel #13393; see also ATel # 13391 for early photometry by Ho et al.). The VLA has initiated a public observation of SN2020oi on 2020 January 10. The observation was conducted at 10 GHz (X-band) in the D configuration. We performed an initial analysis of the data using the 3C286 as a flux calibrator and J1224+2122 as a gain calibrator.
The VLA image of the position of SN2020oi reveals a somewhat resolved source. Comparison to the FIRST catalog indicates two previously detected radio sources within 10” of the SN position at a peak flux level of ~3 mJy. Due to limited resolution in D configuration, the detection of radio emission from the SN cannot be determined with high confidence at this time. However, comparison of the FIRST image with the VLA image of the SN position (and the structure of the resolved emission) hints towards an additional new component north (and west) of the two radio sources previously discovered in FIRST, towards the position of the SN. This may be an indication of radio emission from SN2020oi. A more detailed analysis may help to confirm this.
We encourage further radio observations with the VLA and other facilities.
We thank the VLA and NRAO staff for scheduling and performing this public observation.

Further follow-up observations for this bright, nearby TDE still on the rise to peak, are encouraged.

More information is on the ATLAS homepage. We are submitting AstroNotes for transients that are either within 100 Mpc, or have some other interesting feature to bring to the community's attention, such as bright nuclear transients, slowly rising or rapidly fading objects.

There was no detection by ATLAS on MJD 59311.28 == 2021-04-07.28. ATLAS21lyp is offset by 21.7 arcsec south, 5.8 arcsec east from NGC 1964, which is at z = 0.0055 or d = 20 Mpc (from NED), implying an absolute magnitude of M = -16.19 (assuming m-M = 31.51 and A_g = 0.12 and A_r = 0.08).

198," We obtained spectroscopy of SN2020bvc (first reported to TNS by ASAS-SN as ASASSN-20bs) with the SPRAT spectrograph on the 2m robotic Liverpool Telescope, acquiring a single 600-second spectrum beginning at 2020-02-08 05:52 (UT), four days after the discovery.  The spectrum was reduced with the standard LT reduction pipeline.  Analysis of the resulting spectrum using Superfit (Howell et al. 2005, ApJ, 634, 1190) shows an excellent match to the prototypical (and GRB-associated) broad-lined Ic SN1998bw at 6 days prior to peak at the redshift of the associated host galaxy (UGC 9379 at z=0.0252; d~110 Mpc assuming h=0.7).
We note that the object displays a peculiar light curve compared to other known Ic-BL SNe, with an extremely fast rise between the most recent non-detection and first detection (Stanek et al., TNS Discovery Report 61070) followed by a steep decay in the subsequent two days (from ZTF, LT, and Swift/UVOT observations).  Spectroscopy during this initial decay (from our own P60/SEDM follow-up and as reported by the Global SN project; TNS Classification Report 6063) shows only hot, featureless spectra except for nebular emission from the underlying star-forming region.  The SN is now rising again.  This event may be related to other broad-lined Ic supernovae with luminous/fast initial rises, such as SN 2018gep (Ho et al. 2019, ApJ 887, 169) or iPTF16asu (Whitesides et al. 2017, ApJ 851, 107) but somewhat less luminous and significantly closer.
We have triggered additional Swift and radio follow-up, and encourage additional monitoring of this interesting transient at all wavelengths.

213," SN 2020adkm was first detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019) on December 5, 2020 with an r-band magnitude of 19.96.  The light curve is currently exhibiting a slow rise of ~0.3 mag/month.  We selected the event for follow-up using the FLEET machine learning classifier (AstroNote 2020-195; Gomez et al. 2020), which gave the event a score of P(SLSN-I) = 62%.   
On January 14, 2021 we obtained a spectrum of SN 2020adkm spanning 3500-8500 angstroms using the Blue Channel Spectrograph mounted on the 6.5-m MMT Telescope.  The spectrum overall exhibits a close match to the pre-peak spectrum of the hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova SN 2015bn (Nicholl et al. 2016).  Narrow host emission lines are detected from [OIII] and H-alpha at a redshift of z = 0.226, implying a r-band absolute magnitude of M ~ -22 on January 18, 2021 after correction for the large Galactic extinction of E(B-V) = 0.473 (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011).
In addition, we identify a broad P-Cygni feature near H-alpha with absorption at ~6400 angstroms that distinguishes SN 2020adkm from SN 2015bn, though SN 2015bn did show weak absorption at this location several weeks before peak which later disappeared (Nicholl et al. 2016).  The absorption is reminiscent of the claimed C II absorption seen in SN 2018bsz (Anderson et al. 2018), possibly indicating C II at lower velocity.  However, we do not find convincing evidence for other C II lines in SN 2020adkm, making an interpretation as H-alpha more likely.  Assuming the feature is due to H-alpha we find the absorption minimum corresponds to a velocity of ~7000 km/s.  If confirmed as H-alpha this event will add to a growing sample of SLSNe with hydrogen that otherwise match the spectra of hydrogen-poor events, indicating that some SLSN progenitors are not entirely stripped of their hydrogen envelopes.
Further observations are ongoing.    
We thank the entire MMT team for making these observations possible.

216," We report the discovery of the fast optical transient ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019) at coordinates (J2000, <0.5”):
RA = 07:48:19.32 (117.08054d)
Dec = +11:24:34.21 (+11.40949d)
ZTF21aagwbjr was first detected at r=17.11 mag on 2021-02-04 07:07 UT, hereafter labelled T_det, with an upper limit (g > 18.74 mag) 1.9 hours prior. It faded by ~2.1 mag in r-band in the next 0.9 days. The transient was most recently detected on 2021-02-05 06:07 UT at g = 19.70 ± 0.07 mag. The color appears to be red, with g-r~0.4 on 2021-02-05. The Galactic extinction along the line of sight is low, with E(B-V)=0.04 mag (Planck Collaboration et al., 2015).
We note that ZTF21aagwbjr falls in the center of the error region of GRB210204A (GCN 29390), a long burst triggered by Fermi GBM 45 minutes before T_det. ZTF21aagwbjr is temporally and spatially consistent with GRB210204A (see https://zwicky.tf/j0s), and likely the afterglow.
In the table below, we report photometry obtained on images processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC (Masci et al. 2019).

ZTF21aagwbjr is located off the Galactic plane, with Galactic latitude b_Gal = 17.7 deg. A possible faint host is listed in the Legacy Survey DR9 catalog (Dey et al. 2019, ApJ, 157, 5), at RA, Dec = 07:48:19.32, 11:24:34.3, with a small separation of 0.1 arcsec from ZTF21aagwbjr. The source has a galaxy morphological classification, according to the DR9 Tractor model. The possible host has reported magnitudes of g=24.60, r=23.74, z=23.26, and a photometric redshift of 0.92 ± 0.3.
We encourage spectroscopic classification and multi-wavelength follow-up of ZTF21aagwbjr, the likely afterglow of GRB210204A.

ZTF21aagwbjr was observed as part of the Caltech TESS shadowing survey (ATel #12952), and identified independently by two ZTF data mining programs: i) the “ZTF Realtime Search and Triggering” (ZTF-ReST) project, which aims at near real-time identification of compelling kilonova candidates in ZTF data using the methods described in Andreoni et al. (2020, ApJ, 904, 2), independently of gravitational-wave or gamma-ray triggers; ii) a filtering algorithm designed for fast transient discovery (Ho et al. 2020, ApJ, 905, 2).

AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS20dlr (AT2020lgb) in the host galaxy MCG -01-32-004, at a redshift of z = 0.018 or d = 83 Mpc (from NED). The transient was discovered on MJD = 58995.27 (2020-05-26.27) at mag w = 20.06 +/- 0.08. There was no detection by Pan-STARRS on MJD = 58986.35 (2020-05-17.35) indicating this is not an old supernova. The transient is offset from the host by 3.9"" N, 8.5"" W (a projected 3.7 kpc radius from the galaxy centre).

230," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" which is a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS20kp (AT2020bgp) in the host galaxy WISEA J085129.93+391355.2, at a redshift of z = 0.029, or d = 125 Mpc (from NED). The transient was discovered at MJD 58874.42 (2020-01-26.42) at mag w = 21.44 +/- 0.10. It is offset from the host by 5.3"" S, 2.6"" E ( a projected 3.2 kpc from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -14.12 (assuming m-M = 35.49 and foreground exinction of  A_w = 0.07). Spectroscopic classification is encouraged. 
Information on all objects discovered by the ""Pan-STARRS search for kilonovae"" will be made available at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/. We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached.

232," We conducted follow-up imaging and spectroscopy of the candidate supernova GSNST-20ca (AT 2020rml; TNS report 80195) using the Liverpool Telescope as part of a live observing session during the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) online astronomy school.  We obtained one 180s image in each of the g, r, and i band filters with IO:O between 03:38 and 03:48 UT on 2020-08-19, followed by two spectroscopic exposures of 600 seconds with SPRAT. 

Image subtraction of the IO:O images versus Pan-STARRS reference imaging shows no source at the location of the reported transient, to an estimated limiting magnitude of approximately 22.  The extracted spectrum shows only host galaxy light at z=0.018, consistent with the catalogued redshift of the host galaxy.  We thus cannot confirm the presence of a transient in this galaxy, unless it faded very rapidly from the reported discovery three days prior.

251," ZTF21abaiono (SN 2021lwz) was first detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al. 2019; Graham et al. 2019) in public imaging from 2021-05-10 with a discovery magnitude of g=18.76 (MJD 59344.1809). It was saved as a SN candidate as part of scanning for the Bright Transient Survey (Fremling et al. 2020; Perley et al. 2020).  It was also identified as a fast transient candidate on the basis of its rapid rise (the most recent g-band upper limit is from 2 days before the detection; g>20.57 mag at MJD 59324.22) and coincidence with a dim, blue, extended counterpart in pre-explosion survey imaging from Pan-STARRS, SDSS, and the Legacy Survey.

A spectrum was obtained on 2021-05-11 with the SED Machine IFU at the Palomar 60-inch telescope (Blagorodnova et al. 2018, Rigault et al. 2019).  Only a featureless blue continuum is evident in this observation.  We triggered Swift and the Liverpool Telescope for additional photometry, and obtained a short spectrum (300s) with the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on Keck I at UT 2021-05-13 05:40.  The Keck spectrum is largely featureless in the red arm, but shows probable narrow emission from host-galaxy H-alpha at a redshift of z=0.065, along with (marginal) detections of narrow [OIII] at consistent redshift.  The blue arm shows several weak broad continuum features similar to those seen in pre-max Type I superluminous supernovae (e.g. SN 2005ap, PTF10cwr) but at higher velocities (~ 21000 km/s).

At this redshift, the magnitude at the time of the most recent ZTF observation (g = 17.58 at MJD 59348.9) implies an absolute magnitude of approximately -19.8.  The source is very blue and still rising in all optical bands.  We suggest that this is likely a superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) caught very early in its evolution.  Follow-up observations across the electromagnetic spectrum are encouraged.

On UT 2020-07-31, we obtained a low resolution optical spectrum of the source with the SED Machine spectrograph (Blagorodnova et al. 2018) on the Palomar 60-inch telescope.

The spectrum shows broad P-Cygni features of the Balmer series and He I. Using SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007) on the spectrum, we find a best match to the Type IIP SN 1999em at peak light, indicating a young Type II supernova. Further spectroscopic and photometric follow-up of this very nearby supernova is encouraged.

257," We report the discovery of the fast, low-luminosity optical transient ZTF21aapkbav/AT2021gca with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019) at coordinates:
RA = 14:28:07.332 (217.0305508d)
Dec = +33:29:49.38 (33.4970497d)
ZTF21aapkbav was first detected on 2021-03-17 09:23 UT at r=19.74+-0.06 mag. The last ZTF upper limit before the first detection was measured on 2021-03-08 06:27 UT, which constrains the onset time to be within < 9.1 days. ZTF21aapkbav faded by ~0.3 mag/day in both g- and r-band. The transient was last observed with ZTF on 2021-03-19 10:18 UT at g=20.59+-0.12 mag. Photometric measurements were obtained using the ZTF forced-photometry service (Masci et al., 2018).
The color of ZTF21aapkbav appears to be red, with g-r~0.2 mag. The Galactic extinction on the line of sight is small, with E(B-V)=0.014 mag (Planck Collaboration et al., 2014). 
ZTF21aapkbav is spatially consistent with the possible host galaxy GALEXMSC J142807.45+332950.0 at redshift z=0.036 (Kochanek et al., 2012), as tabulated by NED, with a separation of about 2 arcsec from the cataloged coordinates. Assuming an association between the galaxy and ZTF21aapkbav, the absolute magnitude of the transient first (brightest) detection would be M_r ~ -16.3 mag, which implies an intrinsically low luminosity. We caution that the onset time was poorly constrained (due to a streak of bad weather at Palomar Observatory), so it is possible that the peak of ZTF21aapkbav was brighter.
Follow-up observations are encouraged.

ZTF21aapkbav was found by the ''ZTF Realtime Search and Triggering'' (ZTFReST) project, which aims at near real-time identification of compelling kilonova candidates in ZTF data using the methods described in Andreoni et al.

264," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" which is a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS19fpv (AT2019rho) in the host galaxy PGC 144639, at a redshift of z = 0.017 or d = 73 Mpc (from NED).  The transient was discovered at MJD 58753.54 == 2019-09-27.54, at m_w = 18.13 +/- 0.02. It is offset from the host by 4.50"" S, 0.10"" W (a projected 1.6 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -16.23 (assuming m-M = 34.30 and foreground extinction of A_r = 0.056).  We note a recent non-detection on 58752.53 by ATLAS at o < 19.8, implying this is young and intrinsically faint.  Spectroscopic classification is encouraged.
Information on all objects discovered by the ""Pan-STARRS search for kilonovae"" will be made available at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/. We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
These discoveries are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations supported by the NASA Grants, including No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near Earth Object Observations Program.

(2011). The object was first detected on ZTF r-band images obtained on June 8, 2019 at 5:48 UT, about 22 hours after the last non-detection, and was picked up by the infant supernova custom Marshal filter. The object was saved by a duty astronomer and rapid follow-up was triggered.  A spectrum obtained with the SEDM instrument (Blagorodnova et al. 2018) mounted on the robotic P60 1.5m telescope at Palomar Observatory on 10:18 UT showed narrow emission lines of highly ionised species (OIII, CIII) on top of blue continuum, consistent with a very young and hot transient event. 
The redshift of the apparent host (SDSS J153613.02+394357.5) was estimated at z = 0.064 (~280Mpc) based on the analysis of a host spectrum from Gemini. The transient was hence discovered around r = -17 absolute magnitude. Swift photometry and high cadence spectroscopy have been requested.  Additional observations are ongoing.

279," We introduce a focused search for any intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near Earth Object surveys. In normal survey mode, 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z are taken reaching each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560).
The main goal is to highlight transients that may be kilonova candidates and are in the absolute magnitude range from approximately -10 to -15 (with or without a gravitational wave trigger). This magnitude range brackets published models of r-process powered kilonovae and the peak magnitude of AT2017gfo. We caution that these will mostly be sub-luminous or old supernovae, reddened supernovae, giant eruptions of luminous blue variables , or bright classical novae, given the relative rate of such events compared to the rarity of kilonovae. However we encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up (to identify any fast fading) of these candidates. 
In the context of this ""Pan-STARRS search for kilonovae"", we report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient on MJD 58680.60 == 2019-07-16.60, at z = 19.92 +/- 0.07. PS19dtj (AT2019lkf) is offset by 5.90 arcsec north, 13.04 arcsec east from UGC 12798, which is at z = 0.018 or d = 68 Mpc (from NED), implying an absolute magnitude of M = -14.4 (assuming m-M = 34.2 and A_z = 0.1).
Information on all objects discovered by the ""Pan-STARRS search for kilonovae"" will be made available at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/. We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
These discoveries are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations supported by the NASA Grants, including No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near Earth Object Observations Program.

We will release AstroNotes for transients of note (e.g. closer than 100Mpc, unusually faint or luminous, or rapidly evolving). 
The new transient source is in the galaxy IC 1048. We discovered PS19dlm (AT2019knz) on MJD 58667.32. == 2019-07-03.32, at m_w = 22.09 +/- 0.16. PS19dlm is offset by 34.26 arcsec south, 23.47 arcsec east from IC 1048, which is at z = 0.005 or d = 25.5 Mpc (from NED), implying an absolute magnitude of M = -10.02 (assuming m-M = 32.03 and A_r = 0.08). Followup observations are encouraged.
This unusually faint absolute magnitude could imply a nova, very young supernova, LBV type outburst or other faint transient in the host (if not a foreground star).

285," AT 2021seu (ZTF21abjciua) was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility in the nucleus of a z=0.06 galaxy on July 5, and it is currently rising. An archival SDSS spectrum of the host galaxy, SDSS J142134.55+375434.7, taken in 2004-03-20, classifies the host as a starburst galaxy, with prominent Balmer emission lines.
We obtained an optical spectrum with the FLOYDS instrument mounted on the Las Cumbres Observatory 2m telescope in Helakala, Hawaii (through our nuclear transients classification program, PI: Arcavi) at  2021-07-10 07:56:41 UT. The FLOYDS spectrum shows a bluer continuum compared to the SDSS archival spectrum, and a new emission feature around rest-frame 4680A, consistent with a blend of HeII 4686A and NIII 4640A emission lines. These characteristics have been previously associated with Bowen Fluorescence Flares (BFFs) - a class of enhanced accretion events around supermassive black holes (Trakhtenbrot et al. 2019, Nature Astronomy, 3, 242), likely driven by intense EUV flares that lead to the excitation of the Bowen Fluorescence cascades. However, here we do not detect the OIII 3341A, 3429A and 3444A lines seen in other BFFs. OIII 3133A is possibly detected, however it is right on the edge of the wavelength coverage of the spectrum.

Within a month its brightness in the I-band reaches 16.06+/-0.01 magnitude (http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle4/transients). The SALT spectrum obtained on 2019-09-21 shows a blue continuum superimposed by Balmer, HeI, and [O III] emission lines, as well as a likely blend of HeII + NIII lines around 4660A. An additional, higher-quality spectrum taken on 2019-10-07 shows a similar set of emission lines, except for the HeII + NIII blend at ~4660A, which has disappeared.



Swift observed OGLE19qem for 1.9ks on 2019-09-29. Swift/XRT detected no X-ray source at the position of the transient with an upper limit of 6.0e-14 ergs/cm^2/s at 0.5-2keV.



An ultraviolet source is detected at the position of the transient with the following UVOT magnitudes (Vega system):



V  16.21  0.07 



B  16.39 0.04



U   15.39 0.10  



UVW1  15.06  0.04



UVW2  15.26 0.04



UVM2   15.15 0.04



Taking into account the Galactic reddening of E(B-V)=0.05 (Schlafly et al. 2011 ApJ, 737, 103) the ultraviolet magnitudes correspond to the colour temperature of about 7000 K. The spectral evolution and the SED of the transient suggest that OGLE19qem is a Type IIn supernova.

It is coincident with the core of the host to within 0.3 arcsec (a projected 0.1 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -13.8 (assuming m-M = 33.9 and foreground exinction of  A_r = 0.15). 
Images were taken on the two subsequent nights and we found w = 20.3+/- 0.1  and  w = 20.4 +/- 0.1 . The transient's lightcurve appears to be flat and not declining. It may be a highly reddened supernova. Spectroscopic classification may be difficult given the location on the bright core of the host UGC00179.

This is the third hydrogen-poor SLSN detected at radio wavelengths (iPTF10hgi and SN 2017ens were detected previously, see Eftekhari et al. 2019 and ATel #14393). SN 2020tcw was discovered on 12 September 2020 (TNS Astronomical Transient Report No. 81951) and classified as a hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernova (AstroNote 2020-192). We observed SN 2020tcw 64 days post discovery with the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) with program VLA/20B-144 (PI: D. Matthews). We detected a radio point source within one synthesized beamwidth of the optical position. Here we report the preliminary flux density:
Name | Date (UT) | Mean Obs Freq (GHz) | Bandwidth (GHz) | Flux density (mJy) | Uncertainty (mJy) | RA | Dec

The emission at radio wavelengths may be powered by the interaction of the blastwave with a dense circumstellar environment. This scenario would be in agreement with the recent flattening (and possible rebrightening) of the optical light curves (r- and g-band) from the Zwicky Transient Facility (Kulkarni 2018; ATel #11266).

The magnitudes are reported in the AB system and not corrected for reddening. The reported measurements include flux from the host galaxy. However, we expect the total host contribution to be small based on GALEX and SDSS observations obtained before the discovery of AT2021csp.
Swift/XRT observations were carried out in photon-counting mode. We analyzed the data using http://www.swift.ac.uk/user_objects/. No source was detected at the position of AT2021csp. We infer a limit of 0.014 ct/s (3 sigma confidence). Assuming a Galactic column density of n(H) 2.36E+20 cm^-2, a redshift of 0.081, and a power-law spectrum with photon index = 2, this count rate corresponds to an unabsorbed flux limit of 5.19E-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the bandpass from 0.3-10 keV. At the distance of AT2021csp this corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV luminosity L < 7.1E+42 erg s^-1.

300," We report the classification of AT 2019ein as a young SN Ia-peculiar. Using Superfit (Howell et al. 2005, ApJ, 634, 1190) and SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), we find best fits to SNe Ia, including SN 2002bo 13 days before peak and SN 2001ay. The supernova is closest to NGC 5353 (z = 0.007755, DM = 32.2; NED values), but the features of the spectrum appear to be both blueshifted relative to the host and high-velocity. The Ca II IR triplet is highly blended with O I lines, creating an extremely broad and blended absorption feature. The high velocities suggest that the supernova was caught soon after explosion. Further follow up is encouraged.
Our classification spectrum is publicly available on the TNS.

The observations were performed with the IMACS spectrograph mounted on Walter Baade 6.5-m Magellan telescope on Las Campanas Observatory.
We used SNID (Blondin and Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) cross-correlation software to classify the SN candidates spectra. We found three of them to match typical type Ia SNe spectra, while the other two are very young SNe of type Ia and II. For the latter two SNe SNID was not able to provide a good match to the spectra and phase due to their young peculiar spectra.

302," We report early photometry of ZTF20aaelulu (AT2020oi) from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) and Swift/UVOT. ZTF20aaelulu is a rapidly rising transient coincident with M100 (z=0.0052) that was announced to TNS by the ALeRCE event broker (TNS report 51926, Forster et al.) based on a single r-band detection in the public ZTF alert stream. 
The first ZTF detection of ZTF20aaelulu was on UT 2020 Jan 07.46 (JD 2458855.9588) at g=16.97 mag, and the next detection showed a rise of nearly 1 mag (to g=16.09) in the next 1 day (JD 2458857.0417). The color in the first epoch is blue (g-r=-0.31). 
The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory began observing ZTF20aaelulu on 8 January 2020 at 10:48 UT (PI: Foley and Schulze). A sequence of images in all UVOT filters was obtained. We measured the brightness of the galaxy at the explosion site using archival Swift data and the same source and background regions like for the new UVOT observations. Afterwards, we numerically subtracted the host flux from the recent observations to obtain the brightness of the transient.

303," In order to adapt the TNS for both the present and future needs, and in particular to the activity of transient brokers as significant sources that report discoveries of transients that are observed and publicly released by the observing surveys/facilities, we will perform the following small adjustments to the TNS handling of the “discovery group/s”, so that the activities involved in bringing a transient into the public domain are accurately documented.
The new handling was deployed today on the SANDBOX env., and it will be deployed on the production site next week, on Monday, Dec 2nd, 2019, around 08:00 GMT (including the population backwards of the groups fields for all existing AT-reports).
The single “Discovering Group” designation (as part of the AT/discovery report) is being replaced with two new fields that record both the survey/group that performed the actual observations and the reporting group (broker) that selected a transient for reporting to the TNS along with the relevant annotations. These will appear as:

Reporting Group
Discovery Data Source (the group operating the source survey)

These two entries can of course point to the same group (as is the case, for example, for amateur discoveries, and many of the currently running surveys), and should be specified as part of the AT report. They will also appear separately in the search query options, the ​Discovery Certificate​ and on the statistics pages.
So, for example:


Brokers such as ALeRCE which report on discoveries of relevant transient candidates found in public streams such as ZTF will report in the following manner: Reporting Group=ALeRCE, Discovery Data Source=ZTF.


Querying the TNS for all discoveries of a given observing survey (regardless of the reporting channel) can be done using the Discovery Data Source without having to unite the results for multiple groups.


Some surveys may operate several discovery instruments, so instead of having to choose all relevant instruments, it is more convenient to query by a single “Discovery Data Source” group.


It will be possible to easily query for transients according to their origin brokers including the case of brokers that report on transients from several discovery sources, as expected to happen soon.


 
Bot owners should adjust their scripts for the Bulk AT Reports, whether via JSON or TSV submissions, by replacing the single groupid identification with the following group id's entries:
      ""reporting_group_id"": ""X"",
      ""discovery_data_source_id"": ""Y"",
The new JSON/TSV templates can be found on the sandbox API TEST FORM.
 
*** Important Note ***
Please note that the current JSONs you're submitting will still continue to work until Jan 31, 2020, so your JSON AT reports SHOULD NOT FAIL also before getting to perform the changes.
However, if using TSV submissions, these should be revised and tested against the sandbox, and be ready for use by the deployment on Dec 2nd.
 
Comments and additional suggestions are clearly most welcome.

308," The PTF SN Ia Working group was formed to discover SNe Ia in the nearby Hubble flow in order to make a determination of the dependence of SN Ia properties on their host properties and local environments, measurement of the volumetric rates of SNe Ia, and construct a new SN Ia Hubble diagram. In addition, the group discovered several very young, nearby and unique SNe Ia for which new insights and major constraints on the physics of SNe Ia were constructed. From 2009-2012, the Palomar Transient Factory (Law et al., 2009) spectroscopically confirmed 1,243 SNe Ia. Previous, major releases of data from the PTF SN Ia Working Group followed the publications of Maguire et al. (2014) and Pan et al. (2015), as well as individual spectra for SN 2011fe in Nugent et al. (2011), PTF09dav in Sullivan et al. (2011) and PTF11kx in Dilday et al. (2012) among others. The rate calculation for these events is found in Frohmaier et al. (2019).
With this data release, we are now making public all objects and spectra of the SNe Ia found by PTF. A list of the complete sample of PTF SN Ia is attached. These are direct links to WISeREP for listing all PTF Ia supernova and spectra. In the following months, we will be releasing final photometry for these objects as well. Note that roughly 30 SNe Ia have no spectra as these were spectroscopically confirmed by other groups (as they were co-discovered by PTF and one or more other groups) or the final reductions need to be improved in the coming weeks.
We would like to thank the staff, queue observers and friends who helped us obtain spectra during PTF at the following observatories: Palomar Observatory, W.M.

310," We report the first X-ray detection of SN2020tcw with the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) at 60 days post-discovery (program #21500443, PI Margutti). SN2020tcw was discovered on September 12th 2020 (Tonry et al., TNS Astronomical Transient Report No. 81951) and classified as a hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernova (Perley et al., AstroNote 2020-192) at a redshift of z~0.0645 (d~291 Mpc).
 
We observed SN2020tcw on November 10th and 11th 2020 and detected significant X-ray emission at the location of the optical counterpart of the transient. A preliminary reduction yields a 0.3-10 keV absorbed flux of 5.1E-15 erg/s/cm^2 (1 sigma c.l. between 3.5E-15 - 6.9E-15 erg/s/cm^2) assuming a power law spectral model with a photon index of 2. This corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV luminosity of 5.2E+40 erg/s (1 sigma c.l. between 3.5E+40 - 7.0E+40 erg/s).  The Galactic neutral hydrogen column density along the line of sight of the transient is 1.57E+20 cm^-2 (Kalberla+ 2005).
 
SN2020tcw was also detected by the VLA on November 15th 2020 with a flux density of 0.2 mJy at 6 GHz (Coppejans et al., AstroNote 2021-73). Extrapolating this result with an optically-thin synchrotron spectrum (assuming a spectral index of beta=1, where Fnu ~ nu^-beta) predicts an X-ray synchrotron component of 4E-17 erg/s/cm^2 (0.3-10 keV). The X-ray emission detected by CXO is in significant excess of this prediction by a factor of ~100 and we thus suggest that, similar to other SNe, the X-ray emission might be powered by bremsstrahlung radiation.
 
Subsequent observations of SN2020tcw in December 2020 revealed no significant X-ray emission to a 0.3-10 keV luminosity upper limit of 1.5E+40 erg/s (3 sigma c.l.). This shows that the X-ray emission has faded, supporting a physical association of the detected X-ray emission with SN2020tcw. Further multi-wavelength observations are planned.
 
We thank the entire CXO team for making these observations possible.

314," The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has begun nightly concurrent observations of TESS sector 14 on July 18, 2019. Most of this sector is covered by ZTF except TESS Camera 4 due to the visibility limits from Palomar. Each ZTF pointing has one exposure each for g and r filter. Based on the first three night observations, we found four ZTF transients ZTF19abfwtkw (AT2019lcn), ZTF19abgnuri (AT2019lkt), ZTF19abgncfz (AT2019liw) and ZTF19abgndlf (SN2019lkr) in this sector. Followup spectral classifications are encouraged.
ZTF plans to conduct a public, nightly concurrent survey of all 13 TESS northern sectors in 2019-2020. The ZTF transient alerts in the TESS fields will have the keyword ""programpi"" in the candidate block set to ""TESS"". In addition to the ZTF alert streams provided by various alert brokers, all ZTF-TESS alerts will be released nightly to the public via ZTF's bucket on Google Cloud in a compressed tarball with the alert packets converted into JSON format. Details on how to access these alerts are given in the following Jupyter notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/github/dmitryduev/kowalski/blob/master.... ZTF-TESS alerts will also be cross-matched against a number of external catalogs, including 2MASS PSC, AllWISE, IPHAS DR2 and Gaia DR2. While nightly observations are planned, in the event of bad weather or system problems, no tarball will be generated.
We anticipate that ZTF light curves for all objects observed concurrently by TESS and ZTF will be made available publicly within one month of the end of a TESS sector observation campaign. Details on how to access the ZTF light curve data will be given in the same Jupyter notebook as mentioned above. These light curves are constructed from sources extracted from the undifferenced epochal science images, using seed detections from the deeper reference images (co-adds).
Supernova candidates identified using a combination of automated filters and human vetting will be automatically posted to the Transient Name Server (TNS) at https://www.wis-tns.org with the ""sender"" keyword set to ""ZTF_TESS"".  These will include bright (<19 mag) candidates, which are also selected by the ongoing ZTF Bright Transient Survey (BTS; ATEL #11688). We encourage spectroscopic followup of these candidates as quickly as possible to maximize the potential science return from the ZTF-TESS combination.
ZTF is a project led by PI S. R. Kulkarni at Caltech (see ATEL #11266), and includes IPAC; WIS, Israel; OKC, Sweden; JSI/UMd, USA; UW,USA; DESY, Germany; NRC, Taiwan; UW Milwaukee, USA and LANL USA.

330," The Asiago Transient Classification Program (Tomasella et al. 2014, AN, 335, 841) reports the spectroscopic observation of AT2021hpr (discovery report in TNS supplied by K. Itagaki).
The observation was  obtained with the Asiago 1.82m Copernico Telescope (+ AFOSC; range 340-820 nm; resolution 1.4 nm).
The spectrum shows several broad features reminiscent of the early spectra of Ic-BL supernovae.A broad absorption centred at about 591.0 nm (rest frame) can be identified  with SiII 635.5 nm and then an expansion velocity of about 21000 km/s can be estimated. However, this feature appears much stronger that in typical Ic spectrum and more consistent with the SiII feature in SN Ia. At this stage, the classification remain uncertain.
The classification was performed using the GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488, 383) and SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) tools.

331," The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al. 2019; Graham et al. 2019) Infant Supernova Science Program (Gal-Yam 2019) reports the early discovery and rapid follow-up of AT 2021gno (ZTF21aaqhhfu) and AT 2021gmj (ZTF21aaqgmjt), following the methodology outlined by Gal-Yam et al. (2011).
AT 2021gno was first detected on ZTF r-band images obtained on March 20, 2020 at 05:38 UT (Bruch et al., 2021, TNS Report 103274). AT 2021gmj was discovered by Valenti et al. (2021, TNS Report 103223) on March 20, 2020 at 07:40 UT and independently discovered with ZTF on March 20, 2020 at 05:48 UT by Forster et al. (2021, TNS Report, 103276). Both objects were detected about 2 days after the last non-detection. Both objects were picked up by a custom filter for infant SNe on the AMPEL broker system (Nordin et al. 2019). The objects were saved by duty astronomers and rapid follow-up was triggered.
Assuming the redshifts of the apparent hosts (AT 2021gno in NGC 4165, z=0.0062 and AT 2021gmj in NGC 3310 with z=0.0033, both from NED) the SNe were discovered around absolute magnitude Mr=-14 and -14.5 respectively. Rapid Swift observations have been triggered and additional observations are ongoing.
We will continue to distribute alerts on such early SN detections via AstroNotes; additional follow-up observations of both transients are encouraged.

332," We draw attention to the rapidly fading lightcurve of AT2021buk from the combined ZTF and ATLAS survey data and encourage rapid spectroscopic classification.  
AT2021buk was discovered by ZTF (ZTF21aagysdv; De et al. 2021, TNSTR No. 98379) on  2021-02-04.453 (MJD=59249.453). It is potentially associated with the nearby galaxy UGC 09083, offset by 180"" N, 15"" W or a projected distance of 28 Kpc, assuming a distance to UGC 09083 of 32 Mpc (from NED).  If so, it would be M_g = -14.3 at peak. 
The transient was discovered at g =18.2, r = 18.7, and we subsequently detected it at o = 18.9 on 2021-02-05.645 (MJD=59250.645) with ATLAS (Smith et al. 2020). We measure a fading of 0.16 mag per day in the o-band and the ZTF lightcurve shows the transient to be blue and fading at a rate of 0.29 and 0.22  per day respectively in g and r. 
The ZTF lightcurve is available in Lasair (Smith et al. 2019 RNAAS, 3, 26) https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/object/ZTF21aagysdv/
There is no detection of a point source at the position of AT2021buk in the Pan-STARRS 3Pi archive images. The rate of fading is consistent with those of cataclysmic variables (CVs) that we measure in ATLAS (the bulk of the population show a 0.05 - 0.25 mag per day decline in o-band). We consider this to be the most likely explanation. 
However if the transient were associated with UGC 09093, at 32 Mpc, then the luminosity and decline rate are consistent with the locus of viable kilonova models from Nicholl et al. (2021 arXiv:2102.02229). Using approximately one-quarter of these models (models with chirp mass between 0.7 and 1 Solar masses), we measured the decline rates for ugrizy and ATLAS-co passbands and transformed them onto a contour probability function of decline rate versus absolute magnitude using a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation.  AT2021buk falls within these kilonova model contours. 
Spectroscopic classification is required, although the most likely explanation is a foreground CV.

353," We draw attention to ATLAS21nak (2021kgj), that was discovered by ATLAS on MJD 59322.4 (Smith et al., AstroNote 2021-131). The ATLAS light curve is currently on the rise (o=16.5), and the forced photometry at the transient location indicates some excess flux in the cyan-band 10 days prior to discovery and its fast rise. Regular survey mode observations of the field in Pan-STARRS1 show activity between MJD 59288 and 59315, confirming the pre-discovery excess seen in ATLAS. Moreover, we find evidence of past activity in PS1, with outbursts around MJD 58600 and 58960.

A optical spectrum obtained with the LT/SPRAT on MJD 59325.0 shows a blue continuum with narrow emission features of H alpha, beta and gamma. The lack of broad P-Cygni features in the spectrum suggests it is similar to that of the 2012b event in SN 2009ip (e.g. Pastorello et al. 2013, ApJ, 767, 1; Mauerhan et al. 2013, MNRAS, 430, 1801). Another spectrum taken on the UH2.2m+SNIFS on MJD 59327.4 at higher resolution confirms the narrow H-Balmer lines in emission and lack of P-Cygni absorption.
The rising light curve of ATLAS21nak suggests a current absolute orange-band magnitude of M ~ -17.5.
We encourage multi-wavelength follow-up observations of this event.

We obtained images of AT 2021aczp in g, r, i, and z filters with the 0.4m-SLT at Lulin Observatory, Taiwan. Observations started at 18:46 UT on November, 4, 2021 (MJD = 59522.783), 3.2 days after the last ATLAS observation. The images were taken under a various seeing conditions 3"".0 and at an average airmass of 2.8.
We subtracted our images with the archival PanSTARRS1 template images of the field (difference images are attached), and derived the following preliminary magnitudes (all in the AB system):
g = 19.25 +/- 0.10 mag,
r = 19.33 +/- 0.09 mag,
i = 19.00 +/- 0.10 mag, and
z = 18.89 +/- 0.17 mag. 
Given magnitudes are calibrated against PanSTARRS1 field stars and are corrected for the expected Galactic foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V) = 0.056 mag in the direction of the counterpart (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011). 
Comparing SLT r and i-band magnitudes with the latest ATLAS o-band magnitude on 59519.628, the object brightness may decline ~0.07 mag per day. After the Milky Way extinction correction, we found that the colour of AT 2021aczp tends to be red with r-i = 0.30 +/- 0.14 mag. With redshift of 0.008 (assuming distance module = 32.69 mag), the absolute magnitude is M_r =  -13.5 +/- 0.18 mag.
The ""Kinder"" (kilonova finder) project aims to find fast evolving objects such as kilonovae.

By comparing with ATLAS latest magnitudes, we can track their photometric evolution and seek for rapidly fading events.

AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560).

PS20ehq is associated with host galaxy WISEA J210229.83-092340.0, at a redshift of z = 0.036 or d = 151 Mpc (from NED). The transient was discovered on MJD 59015.53 (2020-06-15.53) at mag m_w = 21.01 +/- 0.21. It is offset from the host by 3.1"" S, 3.0"" E (a projected 3.2 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -15.0 (assuming m-M = 35.89 and foreground extinction of  A_w = 0.16). PS20eid is associated with host galaxy WISEA J130016.32-170138.3, at a redshift of z = 0.016 or d = 77 Mpc (from NED). The transient was discovered on MJD 59016.27 (2020-06-16.27) at mag m_w = 19.43 +/- 0.10. It is offset from the host by 7.1"" S, 3.3"" E (a projected 3.2 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -15.2 (assuming m-M = 34.43 and foreground extinction of  A_w = 0.15). A screenshot of the forced photometry for PS20eid is attached.

368," The Finding Luminous and Exotic Extragalactic Transients (FLEET) pipeline is a machine learning pipeline designed to predict the probability, P(SLSN), of any new transient being a SLSN.  FLEET uses a random forest algorithm trained on every classified transient from the TNS to derive a P(SLSN) value. The features used to separate SLSNe from other transients include light curve information, as well as contextual (host galaxy) information.  We find that maximum classification accuracy can be achieved for transients with P(SLSN) > 0.8, where we expect ~85% of them to be SLSNe; for events with P(SLSN) > 0.5 we expect ~50% of them to be SLSNe. FLEET is described in detail in Gomez et al. 2020 (ApJ in press; arXiv:2009.01853).
Here we present the first results from FLEET.  We used the pipeline to generate a list of SLSN candidates, and obtained optical spectroscopy of six SLSN candidates using the MMT 6.5-m telescope. We classified the spectra using template matching with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). We find the classifications to be in agreement with the predictions from our random forest classifier: The 2 objects with P(SLSN) > 0.8 are both classified as SLSNe, and 4 of the 6 of objects with P(SLSN) > 0.5 are classified as SLSNe.

(in prep.)  We selected transients that have a long rise time (>20 days) and a faint host galaxy.
We summarise properties of the candidates in the Related Objects Table. These include coordinates, current magnitudes, approximate rise times, photometric redshifts of potential host galaxies (taken from the SDSS DR14) and special remarks.
We will distribute alerts on such SLSN candidates via AstroNotes periodically; spectroscopic classifications and additional follow-up observations of these transients are encouraged.

383," We continue our search of supernovae (SNe) in mid-infrared using the recent release of NEOWISE-R 2021, which ranges from December 13, 2019 to December 13, 2020 UTC. Details about our search method in Thévenot et al. 2021 (2021RNAAS...5...58T).
We search classified SNe for this timescale and find 100 SNe with mid-IR detections, which are listed in the attached CSV table.
We find the notable mid-IR detections:
-The SLSN-II 2020edi (ZTF20aasuiks) shows a record brightness for mid-IR detections of SNe. It reaches an absolute W1 (AbsW1) magnitude of -26.5 at 109.7 days after the discovery. We do not find any pre-discovery activity of the galaxy nucleus in the NEOWISE-R single exposure table. The SNe 2020iq and 2020usa are also very bright in mid-IR, but still about 2.5 magnitudes fainter than 2020edi.
-We note that the type Ia SNe 2020aaym, 2020yex and 2020eyj show AbsW1 consistent with type Ia-CSM. 2020eyj has already described CSM interaction (Fremling et al. 2021 2021arXiv210412980F).
-The type Ib SN 2020hvp shows a very red (W1-W2=1.85 mag) color.
-SNe from our list without previous multi-epoch detection were searched in NEOWISE for long-lasting mid-IR detections. SN 2019jys (type IIn) and SN 2019vxm (type II) show mid-IR light curves that are reminiscent of 2010jl-like SNe.

We observed AT 2019rwd with the Las Cumbres Observatory network as part of the Global Supernova Project (PI: Howell). We obtained photometry with the SInistro camera on one of the network's 1-meter telescopes at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in Chile and a spectrum with the Floyds spectrograph on the 2-meter telescope at Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii. We detect the transient at a magnitude of ~18.6 in the bluer bands, and only marginally detect it in the redder bands. The spectrum displays a blue continuum with no obvious broad features, but with a possible narrow Halpha emission line at z~0.286. If this line identification is correct it implies the transient is superluminous. Our spectrum is publicly available on the TNS.
Swift also observed AT 2019rwd on three occasions (PI: Schulze). The transient is detected in all UVOT ultraviolet bands and is declining rapidly (~0.5-1 mag in 2 days). The transient is marginally detected in the XRT by combining the three XRT observations taken so far (yielding a total X-ray exposure of 3.2 ks). Running the sosta tool of HEASARC’s ximage suggests a source with a signal to noise of just 1.8-sigma. The measure count rate in 0.3-8 keV band is 2e-3 counts/sec. Using WebPIMMS and assuming that the X-ray spectrum can be fit with a power law index of 1.7 modified by a Galactic column density of 4e20 cm^2 suggests an X-ray flux of 8e-14 erg/s/cm^2. Further X-ray observations are necessary to confirm the X-ray emission from this region.

397," ATLAS is a twin 0.5m telescope system on Haleakala and Mauna Loa which is robotically surveying the sky above declination -50 with a cadence of 2 days (Tonry et al. 2018, PASP,130:064505). Two filters are used, cyan and orange (denoted c and o; all mags quoted are in the AB system). While carrying out the primary mission for Near Earth Objects, we report transients to the IAU Transient Name Server  (Smith et al. 2020, PASP, 132:085002) and measure lightcurves for variable stars and AGN (see Heinze et al. (2018)).  The frequent sky coverage, to o ~ 19.5 makes it treasure trove for time domain science. A full description is on the ATLAS homepage at fallingstar.com
We announce the public release of the  ATLAS forced photometry server, which provides public access to photometric measurements over the full history of ATLAS survey.  Users can request forced photometry at any position on the sky either for a single position or a list of positions. Currently that is limited to declinations greater than -50 degrees, but will be all sky when the two new ATLAS units are installed in Chile and South Africa in 2021. 
To access the service, follow the link on the ATLAS homepage : fallingstar.com
Forced photometry measurements can be made on either a target image (e.g. for the measurement of flux of a variable star), or on a difference image (e.g. for lightcurve of a transient). Data processing and photometry are described in more detail in Tonry et al. (2018) and Smith et al. (2020). Users should note that this is an experimental service, and carefully read the documentation on the data products on the web pages. While we provide a web form and API, large volume requests are not encouraged without conatcting us directly. 
If you use these data in a publication you should cite Tonry et al. (2018). If you use data for transient time-domain science you should also cite Smith et al. (2020), and if you use it for variable object science, then also cite the first data release paper Heinze et al. (2018).

The Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) undertook a second public observation of SN2020oi on 2020 January 11. The observation was conducted at 44 GHz (Q-band) in the D configuration. We performed an analysis of the data using the 3C286 as a flux calibrator and J1215+1654 as a gain calibrator.
A single point source is detected in the VLA image at RA=12:22:54.917 Dec=15:49:25.01 (consistent with the position of SN2020oi) at a flux level of ~5 mJy. This confirms the possible detection we previously reported at a lower frequency of 8 GHz in an image with a lower spatial resolution (ATel #13398; TNS AstroNote 2020-9).
We encourage further high cadence multi-frequency radio observations with the VLA and other facilities.
We thank the VLA and NRAO staff for scheduling and performing this public observation.

410," AT2021qyd was identified as a fast blue extragalactic transient using ZTF and LT photometry (Ho et al. 2021, TNS AstroNote 180, 1). Recent ZTF and LT photometry suggests that the transient is rising to its second peak.
We obtained spectroscopic observations using LRIS on the Keck I telescope on the night of UT 2021-07-06, corresponding to 11.2 days after the ZTF first detection epoch. The redshift of z=0.049 was measured from host galaxy emission lines.
Classification was performed using SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). The best-matched SNID templates are the Type Ib/c SN 2005bf, and the Type Ic SN 2008D. We note that the spectrum is also similar to the double peaked Type Ic SN 2019cad at 13.6 days past explosion (Gutierrez et l. 2021, MNRAS, 504, 4907).

Two filters are used, cyan and orange (denoted c and o; all mags quoted are in the AB system). While carrying out the primary mission for Near Earth Objects, we search for and publicly report stationary transients to the IAU Transient Name Server.  Data processing is carried out at Queen's University which combines automated source parameter filtering, machine learning image recognition, and spatial cross-matching with astronomical catalogues (Smith et al. 2020, arXiv:2003.09052). More information is on the ATLAS homepage. We are submitting AstroNotes for transients that are either within 100 Mpc, or have some other interesting feature to bring to the community's attention, such as bright nuclear transients, slowly rising or rapidly fading objects.

413," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" which is a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS20cni (AT2020hza) in the host galaxy WISEA J155242.29+134022.2, at a redshift of z = 0.037, or d = 159 Mpc (from NED). The transient was discovered at MJD 58960.58 (2020-04-21.58) at mag w = 21.3 +/- 0.1. It is offset from the host by 5.7"" S, 7.3"" E ( a projected 6.8 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -14.8 (assuming m-M = 36.00 and foreground exinction of  A_w = 0.12). Spectroscopic classification is encouraged. 
Information on all objects discovered by the ""Pan-STARRS search for kilonovae"" will be made available at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/. We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
These discoveries are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations supported by the NASA Grants, including No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near Earth Object Observations Program.

The source rose to peak in ~25 days, exhibited a persistent blue color of g-r ~ = -0.2 mag, and was selected by us as a TDE candidate (van Velzen et al. 2019).
 
On August 13, we obtained a Keck-I LRIS spectrum, which displays host galaxy lines at the redshift z=0.106, a blue continuum, and broad features around Halpha and the He II 4868A complex. The spectral features are characteristic of optically selected TDEs (van Velzen et al. 2021).
 
We triggered the Swift X-ray telescope. The first two Swift observations were obtained on August 28 (1.61 ks) and September 15 (1.73 ks). On Aug 28, an X-ray source in coincidence with the optical position of ZTF21abqhkjd was detected at 3.04-sigma with a count rate of 0.00735 +/- 0.0024 count/s. On Sep 15, we did not detect any X-ray sources at >3-sigma. In the stacked image (Aug 28 + Sep 15), ZTF21abqhkjd was detected at 3.30-sigma with a count rate of 0.00439 +/- 0.0013 count/s. 
 
The third Swift observation was obtained on October 2 (3.11 ks), where ZTF21abqhkjd was detected at 4.33-sigma with a count rate of 0.00787 +- 0.0018 count/s. An absorbed blackbody model fit to the Oct 2 XRT spectrum suggests a blackbody temperature of ~60 eV, and a 0.3--1 keV flux of 2e-13 erg/cm^2/s, corresponding to a luminosity of 6e+42 erg/s.
 
Swift/UVOT observations show that ZTF21abqhkjd is bright in the UV with uvw2-r ~ -0.5 mag.

A 4x600 s spectrum was secured using grism 4 (covering the wavelength range 3600-9400 AA), starting on 2019 Jun 3.97 UT (MJD 58637.973). In addition, we obtained imaging in the griz filters. We measure r = 19.61 +/- 0.04 mag but we caution that this photometry is not image subtracted.
Our observations show SN 2019gsc to be a 2002cx-like (or Type Iax) SN. The spectrum is very similar to that of SN 2010ae (Stritzinger et al. 2014, A&A, 561, 146) around maximum light. It shows a large number of lines with velocities between 2000-3500 km/s and the expansion velocity of the Si II 6355 line is found to be approximately 3500 km/s. Together with its faint luminosity (M ~ -14 mag; see AstroNote 2019-23), this implies that SN 2019gsc is at the faint end of the SN Iax population (Foley et al. 2013, ApJ, 767, 57) and shares many similarities with SN 2010ae and SN 2008ha.

438," Dear TNS users,
The automatic submission of candidate extragalactic transients from the ZTF public extragalactic survey to the TNS has now been active for 6 months. Between 5 and 30 transients are submitted on an average night. The goal of this project has been to provide the community immediate access to high quality supernovae (and galaxy core variables), without requiring knowledge of the more technical aspects of the ZTF alert stream.
We would like to make a few comments based on questions we often receive:
- Two ZTF ""senders"" are currently active: ZTF_AMPEL_NEW submits only transients less than five days old at the time of submission. This is thus suitable for observers looking for e.g. young supernovae, but will by design omit slowly rising objects and be biased against regions with previous variability (e.g. central regions of galaxies). The ZTF_AMPEL_COMPLETE sender uses more relaxed age criteria and will thus encompass also such candidates.
- We work hard at keeping the contamination from variable stars low. This is currently estimated at below 5% for transients brighter than 19.5 mag. We thus use this as an upper mag limit for all submissions. This will only be increased once we can guarantee a low contamination also for fainter transients.
- If a bright ZTF candidate has not been submitted to the TNS there is usually a good reason for this. Selections are made using the AMPEL framework (or broker) and relies on a combination of cuts based on alert properties as well as catalog matches. Catalog information is currently drawn from Gaia, SDSS, PanSTARRS, NED, Milliquas, AAVSOVSX and LAMOST. Please contact us if you have questions regarding a particular transient or have requests for what other transients we should look for!
More details regarding the selection methodology can be found in the AMPEL introduction: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05922. Instructions for how to create a channel to directly process the alert stream can be found at https://github.com/AmpelProject/Ampel-contrib-sample.

r = 20.39 ± 0.15 
i = 20.62 ± 0.15
z = 22.07 ± 0.24
The colours are consistent with a Type Ia supernova at the cluster redshift around one week after the lightcurve peak. The implied g-band absolute magnitude at this redshift is -18.4 mag, also consistent with a Type Ia supernova. We therefore conclude that this source is more likely a Type Ia supernova in the cluster, rather than a lensed background SN, but further observations are encouraged.

441," We report the identification of a fast-evolving transient by the Zwicky Transient Facility. 
AT2021izg (ATLAS21lwz, ZTF21aatsawe) was reported to TNS by the ATLAS survey based on a c-band detection at 19.94 mag on April 10. The first ZTF detections were at r=19.80 +/- 0.17 and g=19.34+/-0.10 on 2021 April 9. The last upper limit was at g > 20.73 on 2021 April 8. On April 11, the light curve peaked at g=19.30 +/- 0.11 and r=19.18 +/- 0.22. AT2021izg stayed at  g ~ r ~ 19.4 on April 12 and 13. Since April 13, it has been fading gradually (~0.14 mag/day). By April 20, the source had faded to g = 20.36 +/- 0.19 and r = 20.61 +/- 0.25. The post-peak color is consistent with g-r ~ -0.2. The Galactic extinction towards AT2021izg is E(g-r) = 0.04. 
The total duration above half-max is 7 days in r-band and 10 days in g-band. AT2021izg therefore fulfills the criteria that have been used to identify fast-evolving transients (Drout et al. 2014, ApJ, 794, 23), and is significantly shorter than typical supernovae (Perley et al. 2020, ApJ, 904, 35).
There was no historical detection in PTF, ATLAS, and ZTF. Within 10 arcsec from the position of AT2021izg, there is no optical source in the SDSS, PS1, and Legacy Survey (LS) catalogs. The LS depth in this field is g>24.4, r>23.9, and i>23.2. We encourage spectroscopic follow-up and classification of this transient.

AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS19frw (AT2019rkg) in the host galaxy ESO 472- G 020, at a redshift of z = 0.034 or d = 149 Mpc (from NED).  The transient was discovered at MJD 58754.42 == 2019-09-28.42, at m_w = 20.28 +/- 0.09. It is offset from the host by 5.89"" N, 10.33"" W (a projected 8 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -15.64 (assuming m-M = 35.87 and foreground extinction of A_r = 0.053). Spectroscopic classification is encouraged. 
Information on all objects discovered by the ""Pan-STARRS search for kilonovae"" will be made available at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/. We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
These discoveries are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations supported by the NASA Grants, including No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near Earth Object Observations Program.

Our slit extends over the body of the host galaxy, NGC 2463, and from narrow Halpha emission we measure a redshift z = 0.026, in approximate agreement with the value reported in NED.
The spectrum shows a clear Halpha P Cygni profile. Running SNID and astrodash yields good matches with type IIP SNe about 35 days after maximum light.

The first epoch of HST UV spectroscopy is scheduled to occur on 3 April 2020 starting at 05:28 UT. There will be a total of 5 epochs of HST spectroscopy over the span of ~3 weeks. An up-to-date schedule is available at https://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/get-visit-status?id=15876
We have also triggered our Swift Cycle 15 program ""Young Supernova Experiment"" (GI-1518200; PI Foley) to obtain high-cadence UV light curves of this SN.
We encourage additional and simultaneous follow-up observations at all wavelengths, especially considering the limited resources currently available.
We are especially thankful to the dedicated STScI staff who enabled this program and quickly scheduled the observations.  We also thank the Swift staff and PI Cenko for promptly executing our program.

AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560).

The transient was discovered on MJD = 58985.42 (2020-05-16.42) at mag m_w = 21.03 +/- 0.17. There was no detection by Pan-STARRS on MJD = 58960.49 (2020-04-21.49) suggesting this is not an old supernova. It is offset from the host by 8.6"" N, 9.7"" W (a projected 12.0 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance, the absolute magnitude is M_w = -15.51 (assuming m-M = 36.34 and foreground extinction of A_w = 0.20). 
PS20dfb was followed up by Pan-STARRS on MJD = 58987.33 (2020-05-18.33) and observed at mag m_w = 21.13 +/- 0.15. This small change in magnitude two days after discovery rules the transient out as a kilonova candidate. However, spectroscopic classification is still encouraged.

A 1.33ks swift observation on July 1 shows the detection of an X-ray source with 0.115 +/- 0.010 count/s. An absorbed blackbody (tbabs*zbbody) model fit to the XRT spectrum suggests a blackbody temperature of 167 +/- 23 eV, and a 0.3--3 keV flux of 1.6e-12 erg/cm^2/s, corresponding to a luminosity of 1.0e+42 erg/s.

Using the classification software GELATO  (Harutyunyan et al. 2008 2008A&A...488..383H), the best-fitting template corresponds to the peculiar type IIn SN2009ip during the phase prior to its giant eruption. There is very little reddening towards AT2020acli, yet the absolute magnitude is several magnitudes fainter than SN 2009ip in a similar phase.

AT2019yzs lies in the nucleus of a bright, interacting galaxy system with a strong blue continuum. We detect nebular emission lines including H-alpha, [NII], [SII], [OII], and strong higher order Balmer series absorption. [OIII] and H-beta are present but much weaker. The widths of the emission and absorption lines are consistent with the 18A resolution. Attempts to subtract the host galaxy light result in a blue continuum with the emission features still present. We identify a broad spectral feature around 4100A at low significance, although cannot robustly identify it. We thus cannot rule out a SN, TDE, or AGN origin for this transient.

490," We report spectral classifications of 18 low- to intermediate-redshift superluminous supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility (Bellm et al. 2018, PASP 131, 995).  Candidate SLSNe were selected from the ZTF public and partnership alert feeds using a custom filter developed by D. Perley and implemented on the GROWTH Marshal (Kasliwal et al. 2019, PASP 131, 997). The filter identifies events of interest using a scoring-based metric that notifies us of sources that show a slow rise time, long duration and/or a high contrast relative to the nearest catalogued galaxy, lack of variability prior to the current observing season, and other metrics.  Our program has classified or confirmed 66 SLSNe since the beginning of full ZTF operations in April 2018.
The table below presents the most recent classifications, associated with observations acquired using Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) on Keck I on UT 2019-07-02 and using the Double Beam SPectrograph (DBSP) on the Palomar 200 inch telescope on UT 2019-07-03.  Comparisons to SN spectra from the literature were guided by the use of SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) and Superfit (Howell et al. 2005, ApJ, 634, 1190).

Notes:
[A] Peak absolute magnitudes are as measured in the rest-frame wave-band matching the observed r-band.
[R] Still rising, peak magnitude is an upper limit.
[1] Spectrum shows strong intermediate-width H-alpha in emission and no other features. Earlier spectra with DBSP close to peak light showed only a blue continuum, suggesting a possible alternative classification as a SLSN-I with late H-alpha emission (e.g. Yan et al. 2017, ApJ 848, 6)
[2] Previously classified by ePESSTO (Chen et al., ATEL12604). We report a refined redshift of z=0.4103 based on detection of host-galaxy narrow emission lines.
[3] Spectrum shows a good match to 2007bi or PTF09cnd 1 month after peak light, redshifted to z~0.5.
[4] Spectrum shows shows strong intermediate-width Balmer-series emission lines and He I on top of continuum-dominated host galaxy spectrum, with host OII and OIII lines at a consistent redshift.
[5] Supplements a preliminary classification from DBSP observations carried out 2019-04-27 showing a good match to PTF10nmn near peak light. The precise redshift is confirmed from narrow host-galaxy H-alpha in the latest spectrum.
[6] Spectrum resembles late-time Ic SNe redshifted to z~0.26.
[7] Spectrum resembles late-time Ic SNe redshifted to z~0.32.
[8] Redshift from strong host-galaxy emission features at z=0.3562. Spectrum is a good match to late-time spectra of SN2007bi at this redshift.
[9] First reported to TNS by ATLAS (ATLAS19mru). Shows strong narrow host-galaxy emission lines on a largely featureless continuum; the H-alpha line has a weak broad component on which we based the classification. An AGN origin is ruled out by a significant offset (1"") from the position of the source in ZTF and PS1 pre-imaging.
[10] First reported to TNS by ATLAS (ATLAS19jlx). Spectrum shows an excellent match to 2007bi or PTF09cnd 1 month after peak light, redshifted to z~0.6.
[11] First reported to TNS by ATLAS (ATLAS19mas). Spectrum shows several broad features which we have not yet successfully matched to any previous transient. However, narrow host-galaxy emission lines are evident at z=0.3642 to fix the redshift and broad hydrogen is clearly absent, so we classify this as a SLSN-I.
[12] Spectrum shows intermediate-width lines of H and He at z=0.3284 as well as strong [OIII] and other emission lines from the host galaxy. Pre-imaging from PS1 and Pan-STARRS rule out an AGN at this location.
[13] Highlighted as an interesting slow transient by Smartt et al. (AstroNote 2019-33). Spectrum shows a blue continuum superimposed with multiple strong intermediate-width Balmer emission lines, narrow host-galaxy emission lines, and no other strong features. The location is consistent with the host nucleus and the spectrum resembles those of AGN, as noted previously by Chornock et al. (2019TNSCR1016....1C). We argue that the UV to optical colors, large contrast versus the host galaxy, lack of prior variability, and lack of spectral lines other than hydrogen favor a SN interpretation.
[14] First reported to TNS by Pan-STARRS (PS19agg). Spectrum shows a good match to PTF09atu redshifted to z=0.67, though it also matches SLSNe-I at slightly lower redshifts. We regard this redshift as tentative.
[15] First reported to TNS by Pan-STARRS (PS19ave). Previously classified as a Ic-BL (Chen et al., TNSCR 938). Spectrum shows similarities to previous SLSNe-I at similar phases, including 2007bi and 09cnd. Its high luminosity, slow evolution, and blue color are also consistent with SLSNe-I.
[16] First reported to TNS by ATLAS (ATLAS19ndu). Redshift from narrow Mg II absorption. The spectrum is very blue with strong rest-frame UV absorption dips consistent with other SLSNe at this redshift closer to peak light.
[17] Spectrum shows strong narrow emission lines associated with the host galaxy, with a broad component from the SN underlying H-alpha. The spectrum is reasonably well-matched to SN 1998s (IIn) shortly after maximum.
[18] Spectrum shows an excellent match to PTF09cnd 16 days before peak, redshifted to z=0.40.

491," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" which is a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS19dxr (AT2019lzx) in the host galaxy ESO 536- G 013, at a redshift of z = 0.032506, or d = 132 Mpc (from NED).  The transient was discovered at MJD 58689.56 (2019-07-25.56) at mag w = 19.60 +/- 0.05. It is offset from the host by 17.16"" S, 9.45"" W (a projected 11.6 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -16.06 (assuming m-M = 35.61 and foreground extinction of A_r = 0.05). Spectroscopic classification is encouraged. 
Information on all objects discovered by the ""Pan-STARRS search for kilonovae"" will be made available at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/. We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
These discoveries are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations supported by the NASA Grants, including No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near Earth Object Observations Program.

AstroNote 2019-48). The transient was also identified with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019) and saved as part of the ""Census of the Local Universe"" experiment (De et al. Astronote 2019-124, De et al. ATel 13546). 


 


We observed AT2020hdh with the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM; Blagorodnova et al. 2018) mounted on Palomar 60-inch telescope (P60; Cenko et al. 2006) on 2020-04-16. The spectrum shows deep O I and Ca II features at z=0.012 that suggest the transient to be a Type Ic supernova (SN Ic). H-alpha and H-beta lines are also detected, but they are consistent with being narrow lines from the star-forming host galaxy at the resolution of P60/SEDM. We found a good match to the SN Ic 2004aw at the host redshift running SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007) on the spectrum after clipping galaxy lines.

501," ePESSTO+, the advanced Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects (Smartt et al. 2015 2015A&A...579A..40S), reports J-band imaging followup of the fading transient AT2021aeba (Fulton et al. AstroNote #2021-291)  discovered by the Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae. Observations were performed on the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) with the SOFI imager (J-band) on two epochs, exposures beginning 2021-11-12 07:13 UTC (MJD = 59530.30) and 2021-11-13 06:54 UTC (MJD = 59531.29).
The transient is significantly detected on both epochs at a position coincident with those reported by Pan-STARRS (Fulton et al. AstroNote #2021-291). We estimate J = 20 (Vega mag) calibrated against the 2MASS field stars with systematic uncertainty of +/- 0.5 mag due to the uncertainty in the background subtraction. This indicates that the object has a significant near-infrared excess.
We note that the transient is coincident with a knot of excess emission in the g and r-bands of the Pan-STARRS archival imaging which may indicate that the J-band magnitude estimate contains significant host galaxy contamination. However this likely starforming knot is not visible in the z and y-band images. 
This may indicate an unusual spectrum. The Pan-STARRS colours are blue but the J-band indicates an excess in the near-infrared which is a factor ~2 higher than what would be expected for a simpe black-body continuum fit (resulting in a blackbody temperature of 7260 +/- 730 K) to the Pan-STARRS photometry.  We conclude there is likely a near-infrared excess, but the level of excess is not well constrained. A J-band excess is not expected for a IIb shock cooling or a luminous LBV outburst. Kilonovae are expected to have multiple components.  
There is no evidence for significant fade, or flux increase, over the two nights but we caution that the host galaxy contamination precludes a definitive measurement. Further follow-up of this unusual transient is encouraged.

509," We are now in a process of implementing an improved treatment of object coordinates on the TNS, based on measured astrometric accuracies of the major reporting surveys, as detailed below.
As described in the bottom section relating to the estimation of the surveys' accuracies, we plan to apply this revision on June 10 (postponed to the 23rd), 2019, and we encourage the community's feedback and inputs by that date.

The new treatment will have an effect on both of the following aspects:
 
1. For every object that has multiple public discovery (AT) reports from different surveys, the principal object coordinates will be set according to the report of the group for which the highest astrometric accuracy was measured (relating to the latest report of that group, if the same group submitted several reports for the same object).
 
So, e.g., if an additional AT report is received for a certain object after discovery, and this additional report is from a group that has a better astrometric accuracy, the object coordinates will be updated according to the new report. All reported coordinates are clearly kept and remain unchanged within the list of AT reports. The discovery credit (certificate) is in any case not influenced by this change.
 
2. The measured astrometric accuracies also come into effect in the automated decision whether to associate a new discovery report with an existing object or if to create a new object. Until now a constant 5 arcsec separation threshold (as well as a temporal threshold of 5 years) was in effect; so, a new report with coordinates that were within 5"" (and within 5 yrs) of an existing object would be automatically associated with that object. 

In the proposed revision, a new object will be created whenever the separation of a new report from all known objects is larger than the square root of the sum of the 95%-level astrometric uncertainties squared of the new report and existing objects, each assigned based on the astrometric accuracy of the reporting survey. In effect this is roughly equivalent to the 99.7% confidence level.
 
So, e.g., if an existing object was discovered by a group having an accuracy of 0.4 arcsec, if that same group now submits a new report with coordinates separated by >sqrt(2)*0.4"", a NEW object will be created based on the group’s defined accuracy. If the group submitting a new report has an accuracy of say 2"", a new object will be created only if the separation between the new and existing object surpasses sqrt(2^2+0.4^2), and so on.
 
 
Estimation of the accuracies for the most frequently reporting surveys.
 
As our fiducial definition of the survey accuracies, open to comments and suggestions by the community, we used the transient reports by Gaia as ""ground truth"". We then made a comparison of the separations relative to the Gaia reported coordinates for all objects with multiple reports by Gaia and the other surveys. We inspected the distribution of offsets and determined the 95% percentile of these distributions for all surveys with >20 coincident reports with Gaia, and adopted these values as estimators of survey astrometric accuracy. See the attached histograms for plots of the top contributing surveys (panels on the right are shown with a fixed x-axis span, 0.0-2.0, for easier comparison of the separation distributions).
Besides the comparisons against Gaia, an additional complexity comes into play and that is the internal scatter of an object's coordinates within a given survey. Some surveys have submitted multiple AT reports for some objects (like ZTF, ATLAS, Pan-Starrs), and analysis of the distributions of the internal scatter revealed that this scatter can be slightly larger than the derived accuracy (based on the comparison with Gaia). Reaching a solid conclusion is difficult (in the process we've encountered cases where objects having multiple reports, from either several surveys or even a single one, should actually be separated to different events; this will be taken care of), therefore, in order to be on the safe side, we propose to add a ~20% safety margin to the dervied accuracies, and relate to those final values as representing the surveys' accuracies.
 
The table below provides the derived and proposed survey accuracy values (in arcsec). For Gaia itself we took a safety margin slightly above the expected accuracy.

All other surveys currently remain with the default value of 5 arcsec (in accordance with the existing threshold value), since we do not have in the system enough reports coincident with Gaia reports from which to draw a meaningful estimate.
This situation is expected to continue and improve as more reports from Gaia and other surveys accumulate, however, we do encourage comments from the community, especially from the existing active surveys on the TNS, to inform us if a specific value (other than the default 5"") of the astrometric accuracy should be defined for a survey, supported by convincing evidence.
As mentioned, this revision is due to be deployed on June 10 (postponed to the 23rd), 2019; so please provide your comments and inputs by then.
The process will also apply backwards to all existing objects on the TNS for which multiple discovery reports exist; so if the current coordinates of an object differ from the coordinates reported for the same object by the group with the highest defined accuracy, the principal coordinates will be updated. Clearly, a log of the changes will be provided after processing.

The observation was performed with the Asiago 1.22m Galileo Telescope (+B&C 300tr; range 330-700 nm; resolution 0.7 nm).
The noisy spectrum is similar to that of a Dwarf Nova in outburst, with a blue continuum and broad (FWHM~5,000 km/s) Balmer lines in absorption. The Hdelta line is more prominent than both Hgamma and Hbeta, and Hepsilon is also present, while Halpha is not visible, probably filled by the emission from the accretion disk.

513," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" which is a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of intrinsically faint transients PS21dkh (AT2021kmo) in the host galaxy KUG 1138+291, at a redshift of z = 0.023, or d = 99 Mpc (from NED); and PS21dki (AT2021kmp) in the host galaxy UGC 06204, at a redshift of z = 0.021, or d = 90 Mpc (NED). PS21dkh was discovered on MJD 59320.28 (2021-04-16.28 UTC) at mag w = 20.92 +/- 0.06. It is offset from the host by 4.0"" N, 5.1"" E (a projected 3.1 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude for PS21dkh is M_w = -14.1 +/- 0.2 (assuming m-M = 34.99 and foreground exinction of  A_w = 0.05). PS21dki was discovered on MJD 59321.25 (2021-04-17.25 UTC) at mag w = 21.84 +/- 0.18. It is offset from the host by 18.6"" N, 7.9"" E (a projected 8.6 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude for PS21dki is M_w = -13.0 +/- 0.2.
We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
The discoveries from this program are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations. Operation of the Pan-STARRS1 and Pan-STARRS2 telescopes is primarily supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under Grant No. NNX12AR65G and Grant No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near Earth Object Observations Program. Data are processed at Queen's University Belfast enabled through the STFC grants ST/P000312/1 and ST/T000198/1.

YSE observes with a three-day cadence in combinations of g, r, and i bands during dark/grey time, and combinations of r, i, and z bands during bright time.  We observe in two bands per epoch with exposure times of 27s per band and a limiting magnitude during dark time of approximately 21.5.  The survey began on November 24th with an initial survey area of approximately 80 degrees per night for a total survey area of 250 square degrees every three nights, and this area will increase to approximately 1500 square degrees in the coming weeks.
Data are processed with the IPP difference imaging pipeline at the IfA in Hawaii (Magnier et al., 2016, arXiv:1612.05240) and the Transient Science Server at Queen's University Belfast, the same pipeline used for the Pan-STARRS Survey for Transients (Huber et al., 2015, ATel #7153).  New transient discoveries will be publicly released via the Transient Name Server and will be cross-matched with previously discovered transients.  Here, we report the following initial discoveries: PS19gza (2019wbv), PS19gzb (2019wbw), PS19gzc (2019wby), PS19gzg (2019wbz), PS19gzj (2019wcb) and PS19gzk (2019wcc).

We obtained exposures of 2x735 sec in the UVB arm, 2x 680 sec in the VIS arm, and 4x300 sec in the NIR arm of the spectrograph, using slit widths of 1.3""/1.2""/1.2"", respectively.
We confirm the detection of faint emission at a wavelength ~9355 AA reported by Andreoni et al. ATel #14641. Those authors associate this emission with the [OII] doublet obtaining a redshift of z=1.5105. In addition to the emission at 9355 AA, we detect the [OIII] line at 12563 AA (restframe wavelength 5007 AA) and Halpha at 16465 AA (restframe wavelength 6562 AA) in the NIR arm, confirming the redshift of z=1.5105.
At the evaluated redshift the 4.5"" angular separation between the fast X-ray transient and the galaxy corresponds to an offset of approximately 39 kpc. The peak X-ray flux reported by Lin et al. ATel #14599 translates to a peak X-ray luminosity of 5.8E45 erg/s. Therefore, the galaxy SDSS J134856.75+263946.7 can be the host galaxy of the fast X-ray transient. In addition, the transient can potentially be an off-axis short GRB / binary neutron star merger. This matches well with the properties of XT2 (Xue et al. 2019, Nature, 568, 198).

Subsequent data shows that it brightened to J ~ 9 Vega mag on UT 2021-04-21, confirming a rapidly rising transient.

There is a quiescent counterpart in the UKIDSS DR6 Galactic Plane Survey (Lucas et al. 2012), with J = 17.50 +/- 0.02 Vega mag, H = 16.32 +/- 0.02 Vega mag, K = 15.61 +/- 0.02 Vega mag. There is also a quiescent detection in the Pan-STARRS PS1 catalog (Chambers et al. 2016), with z = 20.6 +/- 0.3 Vega mag, y = 19.8 +/- 0.1 Vega mag. A faint source is also seen in 2004 Spitzer images at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. Instead, there is no source at this position in archival 2MASS images. Based on the average between the UKIDSS and PS1 positions, the location of the quiescent counterpart is RA 19:07:58.65, Dec +08:43:45.3. The integrated extinction along this line of sight is ~ 23 mag in the g band and ~ 5 mag in the J band (Schlafly et al. 2011).

On UT 2021-04-21, we obtained a low-resolution optical spectrum using the SED Machine Spectrograph on the Palomar 60-inch telescope (Blagorodnova et al. 2018). From the huge increase in J-band brightness (already almost 9 mag) we expected to see the spectrum of a nova. However, the spectrum shows a featureless and steep reddened continuum. We are unable to identify strong emission lines of the Balmer series or O I, typically seen in classical nova eruptions. Photometry from the SEDM guider camera suggests that the transient is at r ~ 17.5 mag, indicating a r - J color of ~ 8.5 mag.
The nature of the source thus remains unclear, and we encourage rapid spectroscopic follow-up to identify its type.

Two filters are used, cyan and orange (denoted c and o; all mags quoted are in the AB system). While carrying out the primary mission for Near-Earth Objects, we search for and publicly report stationary transients to the IAU Transient Name Server.  Data processing is carried out at Queen's University which combines automated source parameter filtering, machine learning image recognition, and spatial cross-matching with astronomical catalogues (Smith et al. 2020, arXiv:2003.09052). More information is on the ATLAS homepage. We are submitting AstroNotes for transients that are either within 100 Mpc or have some other interesting feature to bring to the community's attention, such as bright nuclear transients, slowly rising or rapidly fading objects.

528," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" which is a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We draw attention to PS20cph (AT2020inm) in the nearby host galaxy M104, discovered by Pan-STARRS2. It was discovered on MJD 58965.35 (2020-04-26.35) at a magnitude of w = 20.03 +/- 0.10. It was also detected in Pan-STARRS1 data either side of the PS2 discovery on MJD 58961.37 (at w = 22.24 +/- 0.34, from a forced photometry measurement at the position) and again on MJD 58966.32 (at w = 20.9 +/- 0.50).  We give a large error because this PS1 detection is close to a chip gap (masked region), and while the transient is clearly visible the photometry has a large systematic error. We provide a lightcurve and finder attached. 
This indicates a rapid rise (at least ~2 mags in a maximum of 5 days) and rapid decline (between ~0.4 to 0.9 mag in 1 day). The transient is not detected in a subsequent 20 min r-band exposure (limiting magnitude of r ~ 19.5 due to high background counts) on MJD 58971.88 obtained at the Liverpool Telescope (Steele et al. 2004). PS1 followup optical photometry could not be carried out due to proximity with the Moon. 
Adopting a distance modulus of 30.2 +/- 0.6 mag for M104 (from NED), the absolute magnitude for the PS2 detection is w = -10.3 +/- 0.6.  This is possibly a nova and would be on the extreme end of the MMRD (maximum magnitude vs rate of decline relationship e.g. see Della Valle & Izzo 2020, arXiv:2004.06540)
Followup photometric and spectroscopic observations are encouraged to determine if it is indeed a nova or some other unusual faint transient.

The transient, associated with NGC 5371 (z=0.009), was discovered by Koichi Itagaki on MJD 58877.77 (2020-01-29 18:27:37) at 16.7 magnitude (clear filter). ATLAS (Tonry et al. 2018, PASP, 13, 064505) detected the transient on MJD 58878.53 at an orange band magnitude of m_o = 16.44 +/- 0.02 (M_o ~ -16), following non-detections on MJD 58874.67 and 58876.67. 
The spectrum (4000-8000 A) is largely featureless with a blue continuum, lacking flash ionization features. A shallow, broad feature is possibly detected between 5500-6000. Assuming this feature is HeI 5876, the deduced velocity is ~11,000 km/sec. The ATLAS photometry indicates a rapid rise of ~3 mag in a span of roughly 2 days. The observations indicate that AT2020bio is a young core collapse supernova.

531," AT2020jfo is a young, rising supernova in the nearby spiral galaxy M61 (Schulze et al., AstroNote 2020-99).  During the 24 hours following its discovery we obtained three optical spectra using the Nordic Optical Telescope (ALFOSC) and Liverpool Telescope (SPRAT) on La Palma and with the 60-inch Telescope (SEDM) at Palomar Observatory.  The ALFOSC spectrum was taken using grism 4. 
All three spectra are dominated by a blue and very hot continuum with weak features.  The most prominent of these is a broad P-cygni like feature centered at approximately 4500 Angstroms, likely blueshifted helium.  The spectra also consistently show a weaker but significant broad feature at 6500 Angstroms, likely H-alpha.
Anaysis of the spectra using SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007, 2007ApJ...666.1024B) shows a good match to SN 1999gi, a Type IIP SN, about 7 days before maximum light.  We suggest that SN 2020jfo is a young Type II supernova.

In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS19gkq (AT2019ukm)  in the host galaxy NGC 2770 , at a redshift of z = 0.007, or d = 30.1 Mpc (from NED).  The transient was discovered at MJD 58794.60 (2019-11-07.60) at mag w = 21.0 +/- 0.2.It is offset from the this possible nearby host (NGC2770) by 120.50"" S, 82.30"" W (a projected 20 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -11.3 (assuming m-M = 32.3 and foreground exinction of  A_r = 0.062). This is outside the optical disk of NGC2770 and such a faint absolute magnitude is unusual. It is possible this is a background supernova, and there is a g = 20.1, galaxy SDSS J090940.27+330641.3 at a distance 3.4 arcsec away (photz = 0.24).  Follow up observation taken on mjd 58796.62 showed it had a a mag w=21.0 +/-0.1. Hence the lightcurve appears flat, and a background SN is plausible, but a spectroscopic observation is required.
Information on all objects discovered by the ""Pan-STARRS search for kilonovae"" will be made available at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/. We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached.

(2011). The object was first detected on ZTF r-band images obtained on June 1, 2019 at 05:17 UT, about 45 hours after the last non-detection, and was picked up by the infant supernova custom Marshal filter. The object was saved by a duty astronomer and rapid follow-up was triggered. The object also passed the Redshift Completeness Factor (RCF) filter and was publicly announced by the AMPEL system (Nordin et al. 2019) via the TNS. A spectrum obtained with the SEDM instrument (Blagorodnova et al. 2018) mounted on the robotic P60 1.5m telescope at Palomar Observatory on 10:25 UT showed a blue continuum with a low-contrast broad Halpha line and weaker features consistent with higher Balmer lines, suggesting this is a very young Type II supernova. Observations are available via the TNS. Assuming the redshift of the apparent host (UGC 10436, z=0.030234; d=130 Mpc from NED), the SN was discovered around g=-17 absolute magnitude. Swift photometry has been triggered and additional observations are ongoing.

We draw attention to the fast evolving transient AT2020dih from the combined ZTF and ATLAS survey data and encourage rapid spectroscopic classification.  
AT 2020dih was discovered by ZTF on 2020-02-22 (MJD=58901.429), see TNS Transient Report 62755. It is potentially associated with the nearby galaxy M94, offset by 514"" S, 203"" W or a projected distance of 12 kpc, assuming a distance to M94 of 5 Mpc (from NED). 
The transient peaked at g =18.6, o = 18.5  between 58905.5 - 58906.5, which would be an absolute mag of M = -10 and has faded by 1.5 mag in 3 days. The ZTF lightcurve is available through Lasair (Smith et al. 2019, RNASS, 3 26)
https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/object/ZTF20aaqhsil/
It is now at r =19.7 (58908.5) , and has reddened considerably. A nova in M95 is a possible explanation. 
The transient is 5 arcsec north of a faint, r=22.3  SDSS galaxy SDSS J125035.04+405833.5 with an uncertain photo z=0.11+/-0.08. At this redshift, it would also be around 12 kpc offset from the host and would have peaked at -19.8. The fast decline would be very unusual for an object of this luminosity. 
Spectroscopic confirmation is required to determine the host and confirm if this is a nova in M94 or other unusually fast evovling transient. A finder is attached.

Similar good matches are obtained with the 91T-like Ia SN 1998es and the Type IIn/Ia-CSM SN 2002ic, although the narrow Halpha line is most likely due to host galaxy contamination. We therefore favour a “Type I” classification for the transient.

544," We report the discovery of the following transient object as part of the Pan-STARRS Survey for Transients (PSST). Information on all objects discovered by the Pan-STARRS Survey for Transients is available at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/ (see Chambers et al. arXiv:1612.05560, Huber et al. ATel #7153). We release AstroNotes for transients of note (e.g. closer than 100Mpc, unusually faint or luminous, or rapidly evolving). 
The new transient source, is likely associated with the faint, red galaxy SDSS J013257.19+182049.5. We discovered PS20gxa (AT2019aafl) on MJD 59084.52  == 2020-08-23.52, at w = 21.3 +/- 0.10. However pre-discovery detections and forced photometry show that it was first detected on MJD = 58508 at w = 21.9 +/- 0.1 and has been rising smoothly (4 intermediate epoch detections) for at least 576 days in the observed frame. 
PS20gxa is slightly offset by 0.25 arcsec south, 0.28 arcsec east from the centre of the extended source and likely host SDSS J013257.19+182049.5. At r = 21.4 (r_P1 = 21.6 in Pan-STARRS DR2) the host galaxy has no spectroscopic redshift. The SDSS DR15 photoZ is z=0.626 +/- 0.053. This would imply a current absolute magnitude of M_w = -21.8 (assuming m-M = 42.92 and A_r = 0.15) and the lighcurve implies it may still be rising. If it were at this redshift, the restframe rise time would be at least 350 days. The longest observed rise time for a superluminous supernova is around 125 days (PS1-14bj; Lunnan et al. ApJ, 831, 144). 
We note another a nearby galaxy (8.4 arcsec away), SDSS J013256.64+182047.4, with a reported spectroscopic redshift at z=0.723 on the SDSS SAS (although the features of the BOSS spectrum on which this is based are not convincing).  
The  red nature of the host, its morphology, transient offset and long rise time all point to a very luminous, high redshift transient with an extraordinarily long  rise. Given the uncertainty in the photoZ, it could concievably be beyond z > 1. Followup spectroscopic classification and photometric follow-up are encouraged.

545," Our rapid transient identification pipeline (Ho et al. 2020) identified the candidate ZTF21aakilyd on the basis of its rapid rise compared to recent limits (g = 18.11 at MJD 59256.5084, versus g > 20.29 two nights prior at MJD 2459255.0254).  Confirmation of the transient was provided by i-band ZTF imaging the same night from the partnership survey.   It was noted as a candidate of interest by an on-duty scanner (Yao) on this basis, its coincidence with a possibly distant galaxy, and its very blue color (g-i = -0.90 +/- 0.15 mag).  The source has been registered with TNS as AT2021csp.
We triggered Liverpool Telescope follow-up observations (ugriz imaging and SPRAT spectroscopy) the following night at La Palma.  The source has brightened slightly (to g = 17.90) and is confirmed to be very blue; it is particularly bright in the near-UV (u = 17.47 at MJD 59257.20252).
The SPRAT spectrum is largely featureless but shows a strong, narrow P-cygni feature with the emission component centered at 5040 Angstroms in the observer frame.  Another emission line is visible at 6160 Angstroms.  We identify these features as C III (4650,5696) at a common redshift of z=0.081.  There are no other strong lines visible in the spectrum.
Given this redshift, the absolute magnitude of the transient at the time of the LT observation is M = -20 (at 4500 Angstroms in the rest frame), having risen to this magnitude in less than 3 days.  These properties are consistent with the empirical class of fast blue optical transients (e.g., Drout et al. 2014, Pursianen et al. 2018), although the peak has not yet been reached.   
We have triggered Swift, Gemini, and HST observations, and encourage additional follow-up of this unusual event.

547," Initiated by the CHIME-FRB project and in coordination with additional members of the FRB community, we have designed and developed the required components for hosting and managing FRBs on the TNS. This functionality became operational at the begining of this month, March 2020.
In order to support FRB science, the TNS now includes new functionalities including:

The naming convention for FRB events is 'FRB YYYYMMDDabc', therefore the TNS now operates two name-designation engines in parallel.
Many FRBs are only coarsly localized, so we have added support for area transients, specifying various region (localization) definitions. The available formats (supporting also detached regions) include ellipse/s, polygon/s or a healpix full sky probabilty map fits file. Additional area transient functionalities - e.g. internal cross-matching between area and point transients will be added in the future.
A Separate Report Form and APIs for reporting FRB events.
A mechanism for association and handling of Repeaters: potentially repeating events (at consistent localizations and DMs) are handled as distinct objects on the TNS, associated with a primary (earliest recorded) burst. Association can be managed by users.
Like all other official discoveries and classifications on the TNS, FRB discoveries are fully citable and indexed by the ADS.

Please note the following:

If you are interested to include FRBs in your search results, don't forget to check the new 'Include FRBs' checkbox at the top of the search page.
Limiting the search page queries to retrieve only FRBs is possible via selecting AT Type = FRB, or choosing Object Type = FRB.
Also note that on the Search page there are several FRB-specific query fields in the new section 'Advanced FRB Search', as well as additional specific FRB properties that can be displayed via the 'Columns to display' section.
If you are interested in receiving email notifications on new FRB reports, this should be defined on your ""My Account"" page, under the section 'General Notification Settings'. Note that the default is to not receive FRB alerts, so make sure to update as needed. 

Near future plans include the complete ingestion of the FRBCAT and the reporting of the backlog of historic FRB events, both published and non-published, as already undertaken by CHIME; followed by the reporting of live events by the various radio observatories/groups.
There is clearly room for further improvements and adjustments, especially until the new functionalities stabilize; we clearly welcome any questions, feedbacks and comments.

(2011). The object was first detected on ZTF r-band images obtained on 13 November 2019 at 06:57 UTC, about 23.6 hours after the last non-detection, and was picked up by the infant supernova custom Marshal filter. The object was saved by a duty astronomer and rapid follow-up was triggered. A spectrum obtained with GMOS at Gemini-North on 14 November 2019 at 11:47 UT showed narrow emission lines of ionised species (HeII, CIV, NIII, Balmer lines) on top of a blue continuum, consistent with a very young and hot transient event. 
The redshift of the apparent host (UGC 548) is z = 0.022 (~99 Mpc) based on the NASA Extragalactic Database (http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/). The transient was hence discovered around r = -15.6 absolute magnitude. Swift photometry, high cadence spectroscopy and radio observations have been requested.  Additional observations are ongoing. 
We will continue to distribute alerts on such early SN detections via AstroNotes; additional follow-up observations of this event are encouraged.

557," We report new radio observations taken as part of our VLA Large Program dedicated to tidal disruption events (TDEs). Following its public classification by ZTF (TNS Classification Report No. 10352), we have been observing the TDE AT2021sdu with NSF’s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), beginning on 2021 August 10 UT. The data were reduced in CASA using standard procedures. We detect brightening radio emission consistent with the optical position, with a peak flux density of ~0.7 mJy at ~18 GHz in our most recent multi-frequency observation on 2021 November 28 UT. The spectral index is consistent with self-absorbed synchrotron emission at lower frequencies. We additionally observed the target with the NICER X-ray telescope on 1 Dec 2021. The source was not detected and we set an upper limit on the 0.3-2.0 keV unabsorbed flux of 4e-13 erg/s/cm^2, assuming a 0.1 keV thermal spectrum. Further observations are planned. We encourage additional multi-wavelength follow up of this interesting source.
Our VLA Large Program (20B-377) began in December 2020 and will continue until 2023. We plan to target new publicly-reported TDEs discovered at z < 0.1, to determine the prevalence of radio emission in TDEs. We will report new results from this program to the community via ATels, TNS AstroNotes, and on our program website (https://sites.northwestern.edu/radiotdes/). For collaboration, or to suggest new targets, please contact the program PI (Kate Alexander, kate.alexander@northwestern.edu) or one of the program co-Is.

558," The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) detected a bright (r=16.3) optical transient in a setting field on 2020-10-06.  The transient (internal name: ZTF20abzumlr) was saved as part of nightly ZTF Bright Transient Survey (BTS) scanning activities.   It was previously reported to TNS by ATLAS as AT2020tcw / ATLAS20zst, who report an initial detection on 2020-09-12 at a magnitude of cyan=18.92.  The most recent ZTF upper limit was on 2020-09-05 (g > 19.5).  No observations of the field were conducted in ZTF public data between this nondetection observation and the recent detection, although detections in g, r, and i filters were recovered from ZTF partnership data on 2020-09-17 and 2020-09-19.
The location of the transient is coincident with an extreme starburst galaxy at a spectroscopic redshift (from SDSS) of z=0.0645, implying an absolute magnitude of -20.4 in the most recent observations.
A spectrum of the transient was acquired using the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine at the Palomar 60-inch telescope on 2020-10-14.  The spectrum contains strong narrow emission lines from the host galaxy as well as broad features consistent with SLSN-I templates around maximum light.  We therefore classify this as a Type I superluminous supernova.  While the nighttime observability of this source is currently poor, it will likely be amenable to late-time follow-up in future observing seasons, as well as for multi-wavelength follow-up.

AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS20eln (AT2020njt) in the host galaxy LEDA 867721, at a redshift of z = 0.035 or d = 154 Mpc (from NED). The transient was discovered on MJD 59023.31 == 2020-06-23.31, at m_w = 22.37 +/- 0.20. There was no detection by Pan-STARRS on MJD 58992.33 == 2020-05-23.33. The transient is offset from the host by 16.5"" S, 4.4"" E (a projected 12.5 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance, the absolute magnitude is M_w = -13.8 (assuming m-M = 35.94 and foreground extinction of  A_r = 0.22). Spectroscopic classification is encouraged. 
We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up. A finder and image of the forced photometry are attached. 
The discoveries from this program are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations. Operation of the Pan-STARRS1 and Pan-STARRS2 telescopes is primarily supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under Grant No. NNX12AR65G and Grant No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near-Earth Object Observations Program. Data are processed at Queen's University Belfast enabled through the STFC grants ST/P000312/1 and ST/T000198/1.

ZTF-ReST will aim at near real-time identification of compelling kilonova candidates in ZTF data using the methods described in Andreoni et al. (2020d), independently of gravitational-wave or gamma-ray triggers.
ZTF20abtxwfx was first detected on 2020-08-18 05:20 UT, heareafter labelled T_det. ZTF20abtxwfx faded by ~1.3 mag in r-band in the first 2 days since T_det. The transient was last detected on 2020-08-23 04:51 UT at r = 20.98 +- 0.24 mag. Stringent upper limits constrain the transient onset time to be within ~1 day from T_det. The color of the transient appears to be red, with g-r~0.1 and g-i~0.3 one day after T_det. The Galactic extinction on the line of sight is low, with E(B-V)=0.015 mag (Planck Collaboration et al., 2015).

ZTF20abtxwfx is located at high Galactic latitude b_Gal = 40.0 deg. Deep Legacy Survey, Pan-STARRS1, and CFHT images of the field do not reveal any permanent source at the transient location. The spatially closest source reported in the Legacy Survey DR8 catalog (RA, Dec = 250.3368d, 57.1377d) has a separation of 5.7 arcsec from ZTF20abtxwfx, is extended (not point-like), has photometric redshift of z = 0.73 +- 0.2, and has reported magnitudes of g=23.37 mag, r=22.63 mag, and z=21.86 mag.
We searched the GCN archives, the Fermi GBM catalog, the Fermi GBM subthreshold catalog, and the Konus-Wind triggered and waiting mode data for any possible gamma-ray burst (GRB) counterpart. We found one possible counterpart, GRB 200817A (Fermi GBM Team, GCN #28254). The trigger time of GRB 200817A was on 2020-08-17 09:25:20 UT, which lies in the time interval between our last optical non-detection and T_det. ZTF20abtxwfx is located in the 93rd percentile of the localization region, at an angular distance of about 32 degrees from the central GRB position. We confirm that the position of ZTF20abtxwfx was within the GBM field-of-view at the time of the GRB.

The DDF observational sequences described below will (weather permitting) occur every DECAT night, and will have flexible start times to enable co-scheduling with other DECAT programs. 
The images have no proprietary period, and are available through the NOIRLab Astro Data Archive under proposal ID 2021A-0113. Difference image analysis will be done in real time at NERSC, on both the single exposures and the nightly deep stacks. Public alerts will be streamed to all alert brokers that receive public ZTF alerts, including ANTARES, Lasair, and ALeRCE. All are welcomed and encouraged to do science with these data products.

Every DECAT night, three ~0.5 hour sequences will be done; some nights these will be back-to-back, and some nights they will be separated in time by up to a couple of hours. Each sequence cycles through the fields, obtaining a series of images in the g, r, and i filters with exposure times of 60, 86, and 130 seconds, respectively. In total, each field will be imaged five times in each filter, for a total of 15 photometric observations per night (45 for sources in the ~5% overlap region; no dithering). The 5-sigma limiting magnitudes will be r~23.5 mag (single exposure) and r~24.5 mag (nightly stack).
Galactic -- One pointing in the Galactic bulge which we are calling “DECaPS East” (18:03:34 -29:32:02; l=1.462 b=-3.681). Every DECAT night, two ~0.3 hour sequences will be done; some nights these will be back-to-back, and some nights they will be separated in time by up to a couple of hours.

The discovery report was supplied by MASTER (Mobile Astronomical System of Telescope-Robots, Lipunov et al. 2004).
The observation was performed with the Asiago 1.22m Galileo Telescope (+B&C 300tr; range 330-790 nm; resolution 0.7 nm).
The spectrum is similar to that of a Dwarf Nova in outburst, with a blue continuum and relatively broad (FWHM~2,500 km/s) Balmer lines in absorption. The Hbeta line is less prominent than Hgamma, and Halpha is not visible, probably filled by the emission from the accretion disk.
The transient is associated to the known SU UMa-Type Cataclysmic Variable V362 Lib (Vogt et al. 2021, Kato et al. 2013, Woudt et al. 2012), that during this outburst experienced a brightening by almost 6 magnitudes, from r=19.9 mag (from the Pan-STARRS1 catalog) to CR=14.2 mag.

AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
The second telescope in the Pan-STARRS system (PS2, Chambers et al. AstroNote 2019-81) is undergoing scientific commissioning. 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery with Pan-STARRS2 of an intrinsically faint transient PS19fxk (AT2019set) in the host galaxy CGCG 483-035, at a redshift of z = 0.032 or d = 133 Mpc (from NED).  The transient was discovered at MJD 58761.57 == 2019-10-05.57, at m_w = 20.00 +/- 0.07. It is offset from the host by 6.92"" N, 1.79"" W (a projected 5.1 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -15.9 (assuming m-M = 35.62 and foreground extinction of A_r = 0.261). Spectroscopic classification is encouraged. 
We will release AstroNotes for all these kilonova candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
These discoveries are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations supported by the NASA Grants, including No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near Earth Object Observations Program.

576," AT 2019avd (also known as ZTF19aaiqmgl) was originally identified as an optical transient in the nucleus of a galaxy at z=0.0296, by the ZTF, on 2019 Feb. 9. After about 10 months of decline, it had another, slower re-brightening, reaching a secondary peak during April 2020. On April 28, eROSITA detected a new, ultra-soft X-ray source associated with the galaxy nucleus (ATel #13712), with a factor 90x (at least) increase in X-ray emission, compared to an XMM upper-limit from 2015.
We obtained an optical spectrum of AT 2019avd using the Las Cumbres Observatory 2m telescope at Siding Spring (Australia) during the night of 2020 May 10. The spectrum, publicly available on the TNS, shows a combination of AGN-like emission lines (specifically, NLSy1-like Halpha) as well as a very strong, broad and double-peaked emission feature around 4680A (rest-frame), consistent with the expected location of the HeII4686 and NII4640 emission lines. These features are much stronger than seen in AGN, with F(NIII)~F(HeII) > 0.5*F(Hbeta), and are likely driven by intense UV flares which excite the relevant Bowen fluorescence (BF) cascades. Our new optical spectrum of AT 2019avd therefore shares the key characteristics of the recently identified class of transients from accreting SMBHs, with the best-studied example being AT 2017bgt (Trakhtenbrot+19, Nature Astronomy, 3, 242). We note that Gezari et al. (ATel #13717) report that an earlier spectrum of AT 2019avd, obtained on 2019 Mar 15, shows no such BF features. Since similar (transient) BF features have also been reported in a number TDE candidates (Leloudas+19, ApJ 887, 218; Gezari+19, ATel #13127) and other nuclear transients (Neustadt+20, MNRAS 494, 2538), the nature of AT 2019avd remains unclear.

We are pursuing additional spectroscopic and multi-wavelength observations of AT 2019avd.

The object was first detected on ZTF r-band images obtained on July 16, 2020 at 04:44 UT, < 1 day after the last non-detection, and was picked up by our custom infant SN filter as well as the AMPEL rapid transients filter. The object was saved by a duty astronomer and rapid follow-up was triggered. The object was publicly announced by ALeRCE (2020TNSTR2150....1F) via the TNS.
The lightcurve rose by 1.8 magnitudes within ~1 day from discovery, suggesting that this SN is ~ 1-2 day old.
A SEDM (Blagorodnova et al. 2018, 2018PASP..130c5003B) spectrum was obtained ~1 day after discovery and shows narrow emissions of H and He II indicative of flash features. 
Assuming the redshift of the apparent host (UGC 9684, z=0.01687 from NED), the SN was discovered around absolute magnitude Mg=-14.46. Swift photometry has been triggered and additional observations are ongoing.
We will continue to distribute alerts on such early SN detections via AstroNotes; additional follow-up observations of this transient are encouraged.

592," qTNSm is a stand alone command line utility (written in zsh) which queries TNS and downloads classified or unclassified events for requested months in a given year. The output is a tsv file for each requested month with a header line followed by a line records, with one line per event.  A running activity meter is provided (particularly useful when network speed is slow).  The utility written in zsh is robust against usual user mistakes (e.g.  requesting non-existent months or requesting data before 2016 or into the future).  This is an improvement over ""QueryTNS_SN"" (AstroNote 2020-1) in that the tool can fetch both classified or unclassifid events and more importantly is not limited to 500 records. All records for a given month are extracted by qTNSm.
qTNSm is useful for those undertaking quantitative analysis of events reported to TNS (see, for example, S. R. Kulkarni arXiv:2004.03511).  Unix commands and tools are well suited for tsv files. As such this tool can be useful for pedagogy as well (i.e. assigning homework to students in graduate astronomy courses).
For instance, the header line can be conveniently decoded:
$ sed 1q TNSc_2020_01.tsv | tr '\t' '\n' | nl
     1  ""ID""
     2  ""Name""
         ...
    22  ""Sender""
    23  ""Remarks""
    24  ""Ext. catalog/s""

(in prep.)  We selected transients that have a long rise time (>20 days) and a faint host galaxy.
We summarise properties of the candidates in the Related Objects Table. These include coordinates, current magnitudes, approximate rise times, photometric redshifts of potential host galaxies (taken from the SDSS DR14) and special remarks.
We will distribute alerts on such SLSN candidates via AstroNotes periodically; spectroscopic classifications and additional follow-up observations of these transients are encouraged.
This report is based on observations obtained with the Samuel Oschin Telescope 48-inch and the 60-inch Telescope at the Palomar Observatory as part of the Zwicky Transient Facility project.

602," ATLAS is a twin 0.5m telescope system on Haleakala and Mauna Loa which is robotically surveying the sky above declination -40 with a cadence of 2 days (Tonry et al. 2018, PASP, 13, 064505). Two filters are used, cyan and orange (denoted c and o; all mags quoted are in the AB system). While carrying out the primary mission for Near-Earth Objects, we search for and publicly report stationary transients to the IAU Transient Name Server.  Data processing is carried out at Queen's University which combines automated source parameter filtering, machine learning image recognition, and spatial cross-matching with astronomical catalogues (Smith et al. 2020, arXiv:2003.09052). More information is on the ATLAS homepage. We are submitting AstroNotes for transients that are either within 100 Mpc or have some other interesting feature to bring to the community's attention, such as bright nuclear transients, slowly rising or rapidly fading objects.
We report a new transient source, most likely a supernova in the galaxy MGC 0021278. We discovered ATLAS20qmt (AT2020njq) on MJD 59024.25 == 2020-06-24.25 at m_o = 18.01 +/- 0.12. There was no detection by ATLAS on MJD 59022.28 == 2020-06-22.28 suggesting this is most likely a young supernova. ATLAS20qmt is offset by 0.5 arcsec South, 1.5 arcsec East from its likely host galaxy MGC 0021278, which is at z = 0.014 or d = 65 Mpc (from NED), implying an absolute magnitude of M = -16.1 (assuming m-M = 34.07 and A_r = 0.05 and A_i = 0.04). 
MGC 0021278 appears to be a very faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of M = -14.6. Follow-up observations of ATLAS20qmt are therefore strongly encouraged.  Finders and screenshot of the ATLAS forced photometry are attached.

603," Following the ATLAS detection of the transient AT2020nlb (ATLAS20qoq)
in the nearby galaxy MESSIER 85, we triggered our NUTS2/OPTICON follow up.
Observations were taken on UT 2020-06-25 with gr4 grism and the 1.0"" slit.
The reduced spectrum shows an expansion velocity of ~14800 km/s as deduced from the 
SiII 6355A absorption at a redshift z=0.002432. 
The spectrum looks then similar to the spectra of some normal and under-energetic
SNIa well before maximum. The photometry and constraining non-detection reported
by ATLAS (Townsend et al. 2020) are also consistent with a SN Ia few days after explosion.

We observed the field of AT2021tnj with the Very Large Array (VLA) on July 30 using K (18--26.5 GHz, on-source integration time 41.6 minutes) and Ku (12--18 GHz, 39.6 min) bands (Project ID 21A-308, PI Ho). Data was calibrated using the VLA CASA Calibration Pipeline and imaged using the CASA CLEAN function, using 3C147 as the flux calibrator and J0152+2207 as the gain calibrator. The source was not detected, with K band rms = 7.0 uJy and Ku band rms = 3.3 uJy. At z=0.228, the 3-sigma upper limits on the radio luminosity are <7.2e+38 erg/s (K band) and <2.3e+38 erg/s (Ku band). 
The position of the AT2021tnj was scanned by the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) X-ray satellite on July 20-21. The source was not detected by the eROSITA instrument with a 0.3-2.2 keV 3-sigma upper limit of 2.3e-14 erg/s/cm^2. Assuming a power-law spectrum with photon index =1.7, at z=0.228, the 0.3-10 keV X-ray luminosity is <1e+43 erg/s.
The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory observed AT2021tnj on Aug 1 (on source time = 2.01 ks). AT2021tnj was not detected by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) with a 0.3-10 keV background count rate of 5.8e-7 count/pixel/s. Using a circular radius of 7.63 pixels, the 3-sigma upper limit is 0.0015 count/s. Assuming a power-law spectrum with photon index =1.7, at z=0.228, the 0.3-10 keV X-ray luminosity is <1e+43 erg/s. 
On Aug 1, AT2021tnj was also observed by the UV filters of the Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) onboard Swift. It is detected with UVW2 = 21.96 +/- 0.27 mag, UVM2 = 22.09 +/- 0.37 mag, and UVW1 = 21.75 +/- 0.61 mag (AB system, not corrected for Galactic extinction). The UVOT observations are consistent with the blue color and decay rate reported in Ho et al. AstroNote 2021-205.
In summary, assuming that the explosion epoch of AT2021tnj is <5 days of the first optical detection (on 2021 July 12), our VLA upper limits indicate that the radio luminosity of AT2021tnj is fainter than that observed in AT2018cow and its analog AT2020xnd (Margutti et al. 2019 ApJ, 872, 18; Ho et al. ApJ, 871, 73, Ho et al. in prep). The X-ray upper limits are consistent with the X-ray luminosities of the two objects.
 
We would like to thank the VLA and Swift staff for scheduling and carrying out these observations.

The source was discovered on UT 2020-01-28T06:43:20.640 at r=19.6 mag, which was 0.74 days after the last non-detection. Follow-up photometry with the IO:O optical imager on the Liverpool Telescope (PI: D. Perley) and the Wafer-Scale Imager for Prime (WASP) on the 200-inch Hale telescope (PI: I. Andreoni) at Palomar Observatory established a rapid fade rate of 2.5 magnitudes in 1.25 days as well as red colors (g-r=+0.65, from the WASP observation).
We obtained a target-of-opportunity (PI: M. M. Kasliwal) spectrum with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on the Keck I 10-m telescope, which showed absorption features consistent with the Lyman break and Lyman alpha at z=2.9.
We obtained a target-of-opportunity observation with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and detected X-ray emission at 0.0039 ct/s. Assuming a neutral hydrogen column density nH = 1.77E20 cm-2 and a power-law spectrum with photon index 2, the unabsorbed flux is 1.5E-13 erg cm-2 s-1, corresponding to a luminosity of 1.1E46 erg s-1. 
We searched the Fermi/GBM catalog and identified a reported likely short GRB 24 degrees away: GRB 200128A (GCN #26909). ZTF20aajnksq is located along the 90% contour of the localization region. The trigger time of GRB 200128A is three hours before the first optical detection.

641," We report observations of the Fast Blue Optical Transient (FBOT) AT2020xnd (ATel #14105, AstroNote #2020-199) with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). We observed AT2020xnd on November 4th 2020 (t=21-25 days since explosion) for a total exposure of 29 ks (OBS ID: 80701407002, Proposal 22500192 PI: D. Matthews).
We do not find evidence for X-ray emission from the location of FBOT AT2020xnd and we place a 3 sigma c.l. flux limit of ~3.7E-13 erg/s/cm^2 (3-79 keV) and ~2.1E-13 erg/s/cm^2 (3-30 keV) for an assumed power law spectrum with index Γ = 1.5 (similar to what was found for AT2018cow, Margutti+ 2019). At a redshift of z=0.2442 (luminosity distance ~ 1.24 Gpc), this corresponds to a luminosity of ~ 6.9E43 erg/s (3-79 keV) and ~ 3.9E43 erg/s (3-30 keV). As a comparison, the only other FBOT with hard X-ray detection is AT2018cow, which showed fainter emission than our current NuSTAR limits for AT2020xnd at a similar time (Margutti+ 2019). Similar to AT2018cow, AT2020xnd could have harbored a brighter hard X-ray hump of emission at earlier times (t< 20 days) that had faded by the time of our current observations. 
Despite the hard X-ray non-detection, we have detected soft X-ray emission at the location of AT2020xnd with our coordinated Chandra monitoring campaign (AstroNote #2020-218, Atel #14154). Further NuSTAR observations can help in constraining the temporal evolution of the X-ray emission and its origins. 
We thank the entire NuSTAR team for carrying out these observations.

AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560).

It is offset from the host by 12.2"" N, 1.7"" W ( a projected 9.4 kpc from the galaxy centre).

213.043037 +60.905288 (J2000)
as part of the ZTF Uniform Depth Survey (Goldstein et al. in prep).

ZTF20abbiixp was first detected at r~17.4 mag on UT 2020-05-24T06:52:07 and
faded by 0.3 mag over the next 30 minutes, with a total of four
observations showing continuous fading. The last non-detection was 24 hours
prior (2020-05-23T06:43:03) with a limiting magnitude of r>20.4 mag. There
is no counterpart in ZTF reference images down to a limiting magnitude of
r>22.90.

We searched the GCN archive and determined that ZTF20abbiixp is in the
error circle of GRB 200524A, which was detected by Fermi-GBM and Fermi-LAT
(GCN 27797). The position of ZTF20abbiixp is 0.151 degrees offset from the
LAT position, within the 0.2 degree error radius (90% containment).

The time of GRB 200524A was 1.802 hours prior to the first detection of
ZTF20abbiixp. We conclude that ZTF20abbiixp is very likely to be the GRB
afterglow.

649," The Recommender Engine For Intelligent Transient Tracking (REFITT) collaboration reports the following 11 classifications from SOAR AEON observations with the Goodman Spectrograph (Clemens et al. 2004). Targets were selected from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al. 2019) processed through the Antares data broker (Narayan et al. 2018). Classifications, and the associated redshifts, were made using SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007) and DASH (Muthukrishna et al. 2019), unless otherwise noted.

650," We selected AT 2020wey / ZTF20acitpfz for classification based on its photometric properties, location in its host galaxy, and its host galaxy properties, by using the Lasair (Smith et al. 2019) 23TDE-candidates alert stream created by M. Nicholl, combined with the ""E+A Galaxies"" watchlist, which lists the pre-selected likely TDE host galaxies from French & Zabludoff 2018 (there is now a Lasair alert stream which combines all of these selection criteria: 23TDE-candidates-EA).
We obtained a spectrum with the Floyds spectroraph mounted on the Las Cumbres 2-meter Faulkes Telescope North in Haleakala, Hawaii, on 2020-10-22 13:20:16 UT as part of the StarDestroyers program (PI: I. Arcavi). The spectrum, which we make publicly available on the TNS, displays a strong broad emission feature consistent with He II 4686A, and possible broad Halpha emission on top of a blue continuum. As such it is likely a new member of the ""TDE H+He"" class (van Velzen et al. 2020).
The ZTF public light curve, as retrieved from Lasair, indicates that the event may be pre-peak. Swift observations have been requested, and ground-based optical followup is planned using the Las Cumbres Observatory Network.

Observations were performed on the UH88 on the night of 2021 April 19 on MJD = 59323.492 using SNIFS (Blandine et al. 2004SPIE.5249..146L) and Channel R (wavelengths from 520 nm to 1 µm with a resolution around 1300 at 760 nm). 
Classifications were done using SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007; 2007ApJ...666.1024B). The spectrum shows a good match with SN1991bg (Ia-91bg) at phase +2d, and infers a redshift of 0.037 +/- 0.007 from the spectral fitting. This is slightly closer than the redshift of the host galaxy of 0.044 (from NED), but within the uncertainty of the SNID estimate. We notice that the projection distance of SN 2021jvp is 28.6 Kpc away from the host centre at a remote location, if WISEA J142047.66-194744.9 is the host. There are no other plausible hosts visible in the vicinity.

In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS20g (AT2020fe) in the host galaxy NGC 2642, at a redshift of z = 0.014 or d = 63 Mpc (from NED).  The transient was discovered at MJD 58850.50 == 2020-01-02.50, at m_w = 20.11 +/- 0.04. It is offset from the host by 34.36"" S, 27.53"" E (a projected 13.0 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -13.9 (assuming m-M = 33.99 and foreground extinction of A_r = 0.05). Spectroscopic classification is encouraged.
Information on all objects discovered by the ""Pan-STARRS search for kilonovae"" will be made available at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/. We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
These discoveries are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations supported by the NASA Grants, including No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near Earth Object Observations Program.

669," We observed the field of the AT2021gca/ZTF21aapkbav (AstroNote 2021-89, Andreoni et al.) as part of the Kinder survey. We used the Lulin One-meter Telescope at Lulin Observatory, Taiwan, to obtain images in g, r, i, and z filters. 
Observations started at 14:29 UT on 20 of March 2021 (MJD = 59293.604), 1.17 days after the last observed with ZTF. The images were taken under a various seeing conditions 3"".2 and at an average airmass of 1.5. 
We subtracted the SDSS template of this field with our raw images, and derived the following preliminary magnitudes and 2-sigma limits (all in the AB system):
g > 20.58 mag,
r = 20.70 +/- 0.10 mag,
i = 20.78 +/- 0.19 mag,
z > 19.53 mag.
Given magnitudes are calibrated against SDSS field stars and are not corrected for the expected Galactic foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V) = 0.008 mag in the direction of the counterpart (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011). 
Comparing with the ZTF r-band discovery magnitude on 59290.391, the r-band declines ~0.3 mag per day, which is consistent with the estimation by Andreoni et al.  
The ""Kinder"" (kilonova finder) project aims to find fast evolving objects such as kilonovae. We use the 0.4m-SLT at the Lulin Observatory in Taiwan to obtain images for new, nearby (< 100 Mpc) transients found by the ATLAS project (Smith et al. 2020, 2020arXiv200309052S). By comparing with ATLAS latest magnitudes, we can track their photometric evolution and seek for rapidly fading events. We will report our host-subtracted photometry from our real-time observations measured by using the SNOoPY pipeline (http://sngroup.oapd.inaf.it/ecsnoopy.html) to the WISeREP.

The object was first detected on ZTF r-band images obtained on August 9, 2020 at 04:01 UT, about 2 days after the last non-detection, and was picked up by several Marshal filters (including the Infant SNe filter, the filter for Rapidly Evolving Transients, the Census of the Local Universe and the Fast Transient filter). The object was saved by a duty astronomer and spectroscopic follow-up observations were triggered.
After its first detection on August 9, the r-band flux of the transient rose by 3.3 magnitudes over 2 days suggesting that this potential SN exploded shortly before the first detection.
Assuming the redshift of the apparent host (UGC 06930, z=0.00259 from NED), the object was discovered with an absolute magnitude of Mr=-15 on August 11. Due to the limited visibility, rapid spectroscopic follow-up is highly encouraged.

data (see Smartt et al. Astronote 2020-55), as well as a custom GROWTH
Marshal filter designed to search for transients in the vicinity of
nearby galaxies (De et al. Astronote 2019-124), we triggered our
target of opportunity program on the Gemini North telescope (PI:
Miller) for young and fast evolving transients. Observations were
taken on UT 2020-03-08 in R400 and B600 gratings, dithered in
wavelength to cover chip gaps. The reduced spectrum shows intermediate
width (~1000 km/s) emission lines of the Balmer series, Ca II and O I
at the redshift of the nearby Messier 94 galaxy. The spectrum and the
fast light curve peaking at M = -9 are consistent with a classical
nova outburst in M94.

Opportunity observations. ZTF is a project led by PI S. R. Kulkarni at
Caltech (see ATEL #11266), and includes IPAC; WIS, Israel; OKC,

The lightcurve rose by ~ 2.4 magnitudes within 1 day suggesting that this potential SN is indeed ~1 day old.
Assuming the redshift of the host (NGC 4568, z=0.007522 from NED), the SN was discovered around absolute magnitude Mg=-13.53. We triggered Swift photometry and additional observations are ongoing. The current brightness of the SN is g=16.62 mag. At the redshift of SN, this translates to a g-band luminosity of -15.9 mag.
We will continue to distribute alerts on such early SN detections via AstroNotes; additional follow-up observations of this transient are highly encouraged.

We triggered a 2x900 second spectrum with SPRAT on the Liverpool Telescope on 2019-08-27.  The spectrum shows narrow emission lines from the host galaxy at a redshift of z=0.1075 superimposed on a blue continuum with broad, weak features.  Analyzing the spectrum using Superfit (Howell et al. 2005) finds a good match with a spectrum of the type I superluminous SN 2005ap close to maximum light at the same redshift. 
The light curve is observed to rise sharply during the first two days after the initial detection; this was followed by a two-day plateau before resuming a steady rise that continues until the present.  Imaging follow-up using IO:O on the Liverpool Telescope gives a magnitude of g = 17.20 (AB, calibrated relative to PS1) on 2019-08-27.  This corresponds to an absolute magnitude of approximately -21.2 at the measured redshift.
This is one of the nearest and brightest SLSNe in the past several years and has daily-cadence multi-color photometry tracking the rise starting from 4 magnitudes below peak.  It is in the ZTF TESS-shadowing public program (Yan et al., AstroNote #2019-51), and recovering pre-detections (or deep pre-explosion limits) from ZTF coadds before the discovery date may also be possible.  We encourage continued spectroscopic and multi-wavelength follow-up of this supernova.

We observed AT2020xnd on November 4th, 2020 (t=21-27 days since explosion) with the ACIS instrument for a total exposure of 20 ks (OBS ID: 23547, Proposal 22500192 PI: D. Matthews).
We detect significant X-ray emission from the location of AT2020xnd, and we infer an absorbed flux of  ~3.5E-14 erg/s/cm^2 (0.3-10 keV) for a power law spectral model with a photon index of 1.3 (+0.5, -0.4) 1 sigma c.l.  The Galactic neutral hydrogen column density along the line of sight of the transient is 5.12E+20 cm^-2 (HEASARC).
At a redshift of z=0.2442 (d~1.24 Gpc) this corresponds to a luminosity of ~6.4E+42 erg/s (0.3-10 keV), which is comparable to the luminosity of AT2018cow at similar times (Margutti+ 2019, Sandoval+ 2019). We emphasize that this makes AT2020xnd the highest-z detection of a FBOT in X-rays, the second FBOT with X-rays detected at such an early epoch, and the third FBOT ever detected in X-rays, alongside AT2018cow and CSS161010 (Coppejans+ 2020).

713," We draw attention to the unusual lightcurve of AT2021esi from the combined ZTF and ATLAS survey data and Pan-STARRS1 observations, and encourage rapid spectroscopic classification.  
AT2021esi was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility ZTF (Bellm et al. 2019 2019PASP..131a8002B) on 2021-03-07 (MJD=59280.15) with an internal name ZTF21aaoiaar. It is likely associated with the galaxy SDSS J065003.1+272909.9, locating 0.00'' N, 2.31'' E from the galaxy centre. 
The transient peaked at g =18.49, r = 18.65 on 59280.16, adopting a host photo-z=0.031 (taken from the SDSS DR16) implies the transient would be an absolute mag of Mg = -17.3 mag. 
After applying forced photometry (on the co-added 4 x 30sec nightly exposures) from the ATLAS survey (Smith et al. 2020, PASP, 132, 5002), we find ATLAS c > 20.7 mag (5 sigma limit) on 59277.32. Comparing this deep non-dection with the ZTF discovery, the object has a rapidly rising ~ 2 magnitudes within 3 days. 
The latest ZTF data stream processed through the Lasair broker (Smith, Williams, Young et al. 2019 2019RNAAS...3a..26S) show the g = 20.10 +/- 0.13 mag on 59290.21 and r = 19.41 +/- 0.11 mag on 59290.24. The rapid decline is confirmed by a forced detection in ATLAS of c = 20.09 +/- 0.18 on 59287.28. This indicates a fast decline (1.5 mag in 10 days) and SED cooling (g-r is blue at peak and has reddened significantly). 
https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/object/ZTF21aaoiaar/
We measured the following from Pan-STARRS1 (Chambers et al. 2016, arXiv:1612.05560), photometric observations on 2020-03-18 (59291.44) : 
g = 19.98 +/- 0.16,
r = 19.44 +/- 0.08,
i = 19.45 +/- 0.10, and 
z = 19.36 +/- 0.13 mag.
The object could be similar to the rapidly evolving SN2019bkc (Prentice et al. 2020, A&A 635, 186, Chen et al. 2020, ApJ, 889, LC) or AT2018kzr (McBrien et al. 2019, 885, L23 , Gillanders et al. 2020, MNRAS, 497, 246). It could also be the cooling tail of the shock breakout from a IIb supernova which are frequently detected (e.g. SN1993J, Richmond et al. 1994 AJ, 107, 1022  and SN2016gkg, Arcavi et al. 2017, ApJ, 837, L2). 
We compared the photometric evolution of AT2021esi  with the locus of viable kilonova models from Nicholl et al. (2021 arXiv:2102.02229). We placed the models onto a contour probability function of decline rate versus absolute magnitude by applying a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation. The decline rate of AT2021esi is on par with the slowest declining kilonovae in the model set but is intrinsically more luminous.

716," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" which is a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near-Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS20dgq (AT2020kog) in the host galaxy NGC 6106, at a redshift of z = 0.005 or d = 26 Mpc (from NED). The transient was discovered on MJD = 58987.49 (2019-05-18.49) at mag w = 20.30 +/- 0.10. It is offset from the host by 42.7"" N, 9.1"" E (a projected 5.8 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -11.90 (assuming m-M = 32.08 and foreground extinction of  A_w = 0.12).
There exists unusual pre-rise activity in the photometry of PS20dgq up to 25 days before discovery. This activity likely rules PS20dgq out as a kilonova candidate, however, combined with the intrinsic faintness this is still a peculiar transient event. A luminous stellar outburst is possible, or a rising supernova that would become detectable with ATLAS and ZTF. Spectroscopic classification is therefore strongly encouraged. A plot of the forced photometry is attached.
We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
These discoveries are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations supported by the NASA Grants, including No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near-Earth Object Observations Program.

729," We report the first radio detection of the supernova (SN) 2017ens. The object was initially spectroscopically classified as a hydrogen-poor, broad-line Ic SN. Unusually for this class though, the transient quickly reached a peak luminosity of -21.1 mag in g-band (Chen et al. 2018), more typical of super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe). This is the second hydrogen-poor SLSN detected at radio wavelengths (the first was iPTF10hgi, see Eftekhari et al. 2019). We observed SN 2017ens on 28 January 2021 with the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) with program VLA/20B-144 (PI: D. Matthews). We detected an unresolved radio source within one synthesized beamwidth of the optical position. The emission is optically thin at 6 GHz. Here we report the preliminary flux density:
Name | Date (UT) | Mean Obs Freq (GHz) | Bandwidth (GHz) | Flux density (microJy) | Uncertainty (microJy) | RA | Dec
SN 2017ens | 2021 Jan 28 12:03:23 | 6.0 | 4.096 | 39 | 5 | 12:04:09.387 | -01:55:52.49
We note that SN 2017ens was not detected in our earlier 6 GHz observations taken at ~2 months and ~5 months post explosion (VLA/17A-480, PI: Coppejans and VLA/17B-225, PI: Margutti). At these epochs we obtained 3-sigma upper-limits of 36 and 20 uJy/beam respectively. The brightening at radio wavelengths at 3.6 years post explosion may be produced by the interaction of the blastwave with a dense circumstellar environment. This is in agreement with optical observations of SN 2017ens that indicate that there is interaction with a dense hydrogen-rich circumstellar environment at this phase (Chen et al. 2018). We are conducting further multi-band observations. We also report this in ATel #14393.
We thank the VLA for scheduling these observations.

AT2019fdr was discovered by ZTF on 2019-05-03 (TNS Astronomical Transient Report No. 34906) in the host galaxy  SDSS J170906.84+265120.5; (an r=19.26 mag galaxy with photoZ=0.231±0.042). It was also independently detected by Gaia and by ATLAS (7 and 21 days later respectively). 
We applied forced photometry (on the co-added 4 x 30sec exposures) and find a 40 day rise time and a bump in the rising lightcurve. The transient is coincidenct with the galaxy core and is now at o = 18.5 +/- 0.1 mag. The ZTF g-r colour indicates it is still relatively blue. 
The combination of the photometric redshift of the host, long rise time, persistent blue colour and bump suggests it could be an unusual very luminous transient and we encourage spectroscopic follow-up to determine the nature of this unusual object. The bump feature we see in ATLAS lies in a coverage gap of ZTF  https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/object/ZTF19aatubsj/ although the ZTF lightcurve is compatible with the feature.

At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_w = -16.43 (assuming m-M = 36.50 and foreground extinction of A_r = 0.11). Spectroscopic classification is encouraged. A finder is attached.
These discoveries are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations supported by the NASA Grants, including No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near Earth Object Observations Program.

735," The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) reports the discovery last night of ZTF21aaeyldq (AT2021any), a rapidly fading optical transient located at:
08:15:15.34 -05:52:01.2 (J2000) 
123.813909 -5.867007 (J2000)
and detected in the high-cadence partnership survey by a filter designed to find fast transients (Ho et al. 2020, ApJ, 905, 2). 
The source was discovered on UT 2021-01-16T06:59:45.6 at r=17.9 mag, only 22 minutes after the last non-detection (limiting mag r~20.28). Two additional r-band observations over the next 3.3 hours revealed rapid fading by 2 magnitudes. No counterpart is visible in deep Legacy Survey pre-imaging (>24 mag; Dey et al. 2019, ApJ, 157, 5). 
The color of the transient is moderately red (g-r~0.3 mag).  While the source is close to the Galactic plane (+16 deg), extinction along the line of sight is low (E(g-r)~0.07 mag; Schlafly et al. 2011, ApJ, 737, 2).
We urge additional multi-band photometry to establish the rate of fading and color of this transient.

736," ATLAS is a twin 0.5m telescope system on Haleakala and Mauna Loa which is robotically surveying the sky above declination -40 with a cadence of 2 days (Tonry et al. 2018, PASP, 13, 064505). Two filters are used, cyan and orange (denoted c and o; all mags quoted are in the AB system). While carrying out the primary mission for Near Earth Objects, we search for and publicly report stationary transients to the IAU Transient Name Server.  Data processing is carried out at Queen's University which combines automated source parameter filtering, machine learning image recognition, and spatial cross-matching with astronomical catalogues (Smith et al. 2020, arXiv:2003.09052). More information is on the ATLAS homepage. We are submitting AstroNotes for transients that are either within 100 Mpc, or have some other interesting feature to bring to the community's attention, such as bright nuclear transients, slowly rising or rapidly fading objects.
We report a new transient source, most likely a supernova in the galaxy MCG -02-24-027. We discovered ATLAS20lti (AT2020jgl) on MJD 58976.29 == 2020-05-07.29, at m_o = 18.15 +/- 0.25. There was no detection by ATLAS on MJD 58974.27 == 2020-05-05.27. ATLAS20lti is offset by 4.5 arcsec north, 5.3 arcsec west from its likely host galaxy MCG -02-24-027, which is at z = 0.007 or d = 33 Mpc (from NED), implying an absolute magnitude of M = -14.6 (assuming m-M = 32.56 and A_r = 0.16 and A_i = 0.12). Followup observations are encouraged.

737," We are carrying out the ""Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae"" which is a focused search for intrinsically faint transients, or rapidly evolving transients in galaxies which are closer than 200 Mpc in the ongoing Pan-STARRS Near Earth Object surveys (see Smartt et al. AstroNote 2019-48 for details). 
In normal survey mode, Pan-STARRS takes 4 x 45s exposures in w, i or z each night reaching 5 sigma magnitudes of w<22, i<21 and z<20.5 in each frame (see Chambers et al. 2016, 1612.05560). 
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint transient PS20gtm (AT2020rqu) in the host galaxy 2MFGC 512, at a redshift of z = 0.044, or d = 185 Mpc (from NED). The transient was discovered at MJD 59071.55 (2020-08-10.55) at mag i = 19.64 +/- 0.10. It is offset from the host by 5.7"" S, 5.2"" W ( a projected 6.2 kpc radius from the galaxy centre). At this distance the absolute magnitude is M_i = -16.73 (assuming m-M = 36.34 and foreground exinction of  A_i = 0.029). Spectroscopic classification is encouraged. 
We will release AstroNotes for all these candidates and encourage spectroscopic classification or photometric follow-up.  A finder is attached. 
The discoveries from this program are a byproduct of the Pan-STARRS NEO survey observations. Operation of the Pan-STARRS1 and Pan-STARRS2 telescopes is primarily supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under Grant No. NNX12AR65G and Grant No. NNX14AM74G issued through the SSO Near Earth Object Observations Program.
